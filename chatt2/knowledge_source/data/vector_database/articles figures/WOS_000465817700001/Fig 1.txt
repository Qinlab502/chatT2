Figure 2. SD8 structure and evaluation of its binding pocket on GyrA: (A) structural alignment of E. coli GyrA (blue) in complex with SD8 (red) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis GyrA subunits (gray) in complex with DNA molecule (yellow). (B) Representation of the 2D structure of SD8. (C) Surface electrostatic potential of GyrA and close-up view of binding orientations of SD8 in the binding pocket of GyrA. Blue, red and white colors represent the positive, negative and hydrophobic regions, respectively. SD8 molecule is colored in green.
