Figure 4. Analysis of MD simulations results: (A) RMSD plots of the protein–compound complexes during 60 ns of simulations. (B) Rg plots of the protein–com- pound complexes during MD simulations. (C) RMSF of backbone Ca atoms of the complexes versus residue number in the sequence. (D) Evaluation of protein-com- pound interactions by calculating the number of hydrogen bonds as a function of time. In all plots, the colors indicate GyrA–SD8 (black), GyrA–Galtamycin (orang), GyrA–Quanolirone I (green) and GyrA–Vineomycin a1 (red) complexes.
