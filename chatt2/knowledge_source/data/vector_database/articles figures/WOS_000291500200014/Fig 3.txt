Figure 3. Consumption of 2,3-dehydro-UWM6 (b) and formation of gaudimycin C (O) by PgaE (and/or CabV) at diﬀerent NADPH concentrations. The reactions were conducted to completion with 0(cid:1)150 μM NADPH using 30 μM 2,3-dehydro-UWM6 as a substrate, followed by quantitative extraction and analysis. The relative yields were calculated from the HPLC peak areas.
