Figure 1. HPLC proﬁles (λ 428) of complete enzymatic PgaE (and/or CabV) reactions using 2,3-dehydro-UWM6 as a substrate. (a) In the absence of the enzymes, the substrate remains unconverted. (b) Complete PgaE reaction with an excess of NADPH that results in end product degradation. (c) Coupled reaction of PgaE and CabV under equivalent conditions that yields gaudimycin C. (d) PgaE reaction conducted under limiting NADPH conditions that stalls after all substrate is consumed. A shunt derivative (dehydrorabelomycin) of the extracted product is observed via HPLC. (e) Gaudimycin C obtained if the product from the PgaE/2,3-dehydro-UWM6 reaction conducted at limiting NADPH concentrations is extracted and re-incubated with PgaE and CabV.
