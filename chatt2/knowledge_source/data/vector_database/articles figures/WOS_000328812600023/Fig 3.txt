Figure 3. Structure and activity of the arimetamycins. a) Chemical structures of arimetamycins A–C (1–3). Relative configuration is shown only for the aglycone moiety. b) Cytotoxicity assay against four human cancer cell lines. Previously reported IC50 values for steffimycin against the MDAMB231 and HT-29 (WiDr) cell lines are 4870 and 6790 nm, respectively.[21]
