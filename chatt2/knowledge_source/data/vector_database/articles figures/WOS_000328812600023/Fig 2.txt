Figure 2. Anthracycline gene clusters. ClustalW phylogenetic tree of KSb gene fragments from eDNA libraries (blue labels) and from culture-based studies (black labels). The gene clusters from clone AZ515 and clone AZ129 are compared to sequenced anthracycline gene cluster relatives (dashed lines connect functional homologues). The TX19 gene cluster does not closely resemble any anthracycline clusters deposited in public databases.
