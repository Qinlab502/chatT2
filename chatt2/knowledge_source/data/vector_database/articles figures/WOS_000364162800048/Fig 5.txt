Fig. 3. Clostrubin mediates survival of C. puniceum cells in an oxygen- rich atmosphere. (A) Growth curves of C. puniceum wild-type and DclrA strains in P2 media (fermenter) under anaerobic and aerobic (pO2 40%) conditions. Data are means T SD. (B) Summarized results from live/dead flow cytometric assays [BacLight stain (ThermoFisher), FACS plots, and gating strategy for live/dead cell stain] of C. puniceum strains after 4 days of incubation on potato slices under aerobic conditions. Potato slices were inoculated with 2 × 108 cells of wild type, mutant, or chemically comple- mented mutant (solutions of 1 or 2). Five independent FACS experiments consisted of five biological replicates. *P < 0.001 (Bonferroni’s means
