Fig. 1. Structure, genetic basis, and antibiotic activ- ity of pigments (clostru- bins) formed during C. puniceum infection. (A) Typical appearance of potato tubers stab-inoculated with pectinolytic clostridia. Scale bar, 1 cm. (B) HPLC profile of extract of diseased tubers showing clostrubin A (1) and clostrubin B (2) as main metabolites. (C) Structures of 1 and 2. (D) Minimum inhibi- tory concentrations (MICs) of 1, 2, and Cip (ciprofloxacin) against selected potato pathogenic bacteria (black, B. pumilus; gray, C. michiganensis; white, S. scabies). (E) Organization of the clostrubin biosynthesis gene clusters in C. puniceum (Cp) and C. beijerinckii (Cb). (F) Phylogeny of the principal polyketide synthase compo- nents (maximum likelihood algorithm). ClrA(p) and ClrB(p), ClrA and ClrB from C. puniceum; ClrA(b) and ClrB(b), ClrA and ClrB from C. beijerinckii. (G) Genetic evi- dence for successful gene disruption; WT, wild type. (H) Photograph showing ap- pearance of wild-type (left) and DclrA mutant (right) cultures.
