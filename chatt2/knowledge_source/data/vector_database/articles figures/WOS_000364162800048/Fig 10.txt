Fig. 4. Evaluation of the antioxidative effect of clostrubin. (A) Clostrubin production of C. puniceum wild-type strain on potato infusion agar after 4 days of incubation under aerobic conditions. (B) Survival of C. puniceum wild-type and DclrA mutant strains after exposure to H2O2, as assessed by optical density at 600 nm. Exponentially growing cells were incubated with different concentrations of H2O2 for 2 days; experiments were performed in three biological replicates. Data are means T SD. Bars were not significantly different (P > 0.05). (C) Comparison of clostrubins with typical ROS-inactivating compounds. Potato tuber infection assay was performed by measuring degradation level of potato slices under aerobic conditions. Inoculation of potato slices was assessed with 2 × 108 cells of wild type, mutant, or mutant supplemented with 1 mM vitamin C, cysteine, riboflavin, uric acid, or tocopherol. Exper- iments were performed in six biological replicates with three tuber slices each; data are means T SD. *P < 0.001, Bonferroni’s means comparison test (one-way ANOVA). The photos show representative degraded potato tubers and the negative control (upper left).
