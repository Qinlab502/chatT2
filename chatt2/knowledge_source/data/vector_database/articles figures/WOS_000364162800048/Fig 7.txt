Fig. 2. Impact of clostrubins on slimy rot disease. Potato tuber infection assay was performed by measuring the degradation level of potato slices under anaerobic or aerobic conditions. (A) Potato slices were inoculated with 2 × 108 cells of wild-type, mutant, or mutant C. puniceum supplemented with solutions of 1 or 2. (B) Summary and statistical evaluation of experiments. Under anaerobic conditions, bars were not significantly different (P > 0.05). Under aerobic conditions, the absence of clostrubin reduced potato degradation to <5%. *P < 0.001 [Bonferroni’s means comparison test, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)]. Data (means T SD) are representative of four independent experiments; each experiment was performed in six biological replicates with three tuber slices each.
