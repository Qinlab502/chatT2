Figure 2. (a). Comparison of the gene organization of the core auricin aur1 cluster from pSA3239 [5] with the griseusin biosynthetic gene cluster of S. griseus K-63 [14]. Homologous genes (together with their identity and similarity) are represented by arrows with identical colors. (b) Phylogenetic trees of the ketosynthase α (KSα) and ketosynthase β (KSβ) involved in the biosynthesis of representative groups of aromatic polyketides. Trees were constructed using the Neighbour Joining method [21], based on a comparison of KSα and KSβ from S. lavendulae subsp. lavendulae CCM 3239 with the griseusin KSα and KSβ from S. griseus K-63 [14] and several representative KSα and KSβ proteins from the main groups of aromatic polyketides. The protein alignments and their corresponding descriptions are given in Supplementary Figures S19 and S20.
