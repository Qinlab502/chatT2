Fig. 1 The structures of the inverse epimeric pair (2)-(1R,19RS,49RS,59SR)- alnumycin A1 (1a and 1b) and prealnumycin (2). The recently described4 notation for indicating relative stereochemistry as an extension to the standard Natta projection system5 is used and where the ‘2’ near to the C-19 atom and preceding the name indicates that the number of stereoisomers present in the sample or under consideration is two.
