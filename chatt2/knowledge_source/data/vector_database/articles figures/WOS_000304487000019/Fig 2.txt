Fig. 3 Observed (left) and calculated (right) ECD spectra of alnumycin A1 (1) and (R)-prealnumycin (2). The calculated spectra of 1a and 1b are Boltzmann-calculated population-weighted averages9 of two conformers whilst 1 is an average of 1b and 1a based on a ratio of 3 : 2, respectively, obtained from 1H NMR. This figure, enlarged, is also shown in the ESI{.
