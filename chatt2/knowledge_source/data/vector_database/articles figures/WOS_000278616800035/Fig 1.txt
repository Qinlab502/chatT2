Figure 1. HPLC analyses of the compounds generated from in ViVo (traces A-D, 96 h) and in Vitro (traces E-G, 2 h) experiments: (A) crude extract of S. liVidans TK64/pUL201PW (in ViVo control); (B) S. liVidans TK64/pRab2; (C) S. liVidans TK64/pRab3; (D) S. liVidans TK64/pRab4; (E) enzymes GilABFP, RavCG and JadD with acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA; (F) GilABFP, RavC and JadD with acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA; (G) enzymes GilFP, RavCG and JadD with acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA (in Vitro control). Compounds that were produced in the controls are marked by asterisks.
