Figure 5. Phylogenetic tree for strain 28ISP2-46T and the other group IA Micromonospora species generated using the TYGS and drawn with iTOL. The tree was constructed using FastME 2.1.6.1 [20] from GBDP distances calculated from genome sequences. The branch lengths are scaled in terms of GBDP distance formula d5. The numbers above branches are GBDP pseudo-bootstrap support values from 100 replications, with an average branch support of 98.4% and a delta statistic of 0.135. The tree was rooted using Micromonospora pallida as the outgroup.
