Figure 6. (a) ClusterBLAST [21] hits for the kosinostatin cluster. Homologues of kst genes are coloured as follows: kstA genes red, kstB genes yellow, kstC genes green, kstD genes blue, kstRg genes black, kstRs genes white, and genes uninvolved in kosinostatin biosynthesis grey. A black line at the end of a cluster indicates that it is close to the end of a contig. Gene sizes not to scale. The NCBI protein IDs for Ô¨Årst and last coloured genes of each cluster are as follows: Micromonospora sp. TP-A0468 AFJ52719.1 and AFJ52701.1; Micromonospora sp. 28ISP2-46T QLQ36639.1 and QLQ36600.1; N. valliformis WP_017579213.1 and WP_017579258.1; N. alkaliphila WP_017604198.1 and WP_017604153.1; Streptomyces sp. SM8 PKA38649.1 and PKA38729.1; Streptomyces sp. ScaeMP-6W SCE31237.1 and SCE31955.1; A. bangkokensis OLR89622.1 and OLR89598.1; M. haikouensis SCF11188.1 and SCF11278.1. (b) The same gene clusters rearranged for ease of comparison. Coloured as 6a.
