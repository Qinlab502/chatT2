Figure 4. Liquid chromatography−mass spectrometry analysis of culture extracts of the wild-type A. sulphurea strain integrated with the empty pAB03 plasmid (a) and with pAB03oxyT (b), and of the A. sulphurea ΔchdN mutant integrated with the empty pAB03 plasmid (c), and with pAB03oxyQ (d), pAB03oxyT (e), and pAB03oxyQT (f). 1, CHD; 2, epi-CHD; 3, N,N-dimethyl-epi-CHD. Extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) for m/z 412 (±0.5) and m/z 440 (±0.5) are shown (adapted from DataAnalysis; Bruker Daltonics).
