Fig. 4. In vitro assay and mutagenesis results. Each residue is labeled with the corresponding mutation and the percentage activity compared with WT. (A) BexL N-term pocket mutagenesis reveals that R66, H109, N131, and E135 are important for activity. Mutations of H109 and E135 are especially detrimental. (B) BexL C-term pocket mutagenesis reveals that C-term pocket residues do not contribute to BexL activity. (C) StfQ N-term pocket mutagenesis reveals that N-term pocket residues do not contribute to StfQ activity. (D) StfQ C-term pocket mutagenesis reveals that S216, R218, Y228, Q230, H240, W244, H259, N291, S292, and N295 are all important for StfQ activity. Mutations of R218, H259, and Y228 are especially detrimental.
