Fig. 5. The proposed mechanism for reducing versus nonreducing di-domain ARO/CYCs. During type II PKS biosynthesis, the ACP, KS-CLF, and MAT use malonyl-CoA to generate an unreduced polyketide intermediate. In nonreducing PKSs, KR first cyclizes the unreduced polyketide with C7–C12 cyclization specificity followed by reduction of the C9 carbonyl to a hydroxyl. BexL acts on the C7–C12 cyclized, C9-reduced intermediate to catalyze aromatization of the C7–C12 cyclized ring. The N-term domain of BexL is responsible for catalysis. In contrast, StfQ acts directly on the unreduced polyketide intermediate to yield a C7–C12 cyclized and aromatized product. The C-term domain of StfQ is responsible for catalysis.
