Fig. 1. Schematic diagram of ARO/CYC activity and cyclization specificity in representative type II PKSs. The monodomain ARO/CYCs TcmN (PDB ID 2RER) and WhiE (PDB ID 3TVR) act on unreduced polyketide intermediates to generate C9–C14 cyclized and aromatized products. The monodomain ARO/CYC ZhuI (PDB ID 3TFZ) and di-domain ARO/CYC StfQ act on unreduced polyketide intermediates to generate C7–C12 cyclized and aromatized products. The di-domain ARO/ CYC BexL acts on C9 reduced, C7–C12 cyclized intermediates and catalyzes the aromatization of the C7–12 cyclized ring by dehydration of the C9 hydroxyl group.
