Figure 2 shows the FD, FAB and CI mass spectra, and  FD and  FAB daughter  spectra  of  cosmomycin C.  The  PIFAB mass  spectrum  gave  protonated  molecular  ion  but  neither  the  normal  or  daughter  ion  spectrum  exhibited any distinguishable fragments ions other than  the cleavage of C-7 ( m / z  756; normal,  m / z  753; daugh-  ter)  and  C-10  ( m / z  772;  normal,  m / z  769;  daughter).  The PIC1 mass spectrum did not give molecular weight  related ion as well as any fragment ions. It is impossible  to assign a  structure to cosmomycin C  using  FAB and  CI mass spectra.
