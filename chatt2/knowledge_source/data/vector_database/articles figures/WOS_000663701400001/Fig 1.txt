Fig. 4 Restriction map the Ô¨Ånal pLMX-3-96 plasmid. A pLMX- 3-80 (4.9 kb) Lanes: 1. After restriction digestion with EcoR I/Xba I, two fragments appeared: 3.1-kb pGEM-3zf and a 1.8-kb fragment consisting of 1.3-kb dnrJ and 0.5-kb Ermp; 2. DNA marker; 3. After restriction digestion with EcoR I/BamH I, three fragments appeared: 3.1-kb pGEM-3zf, 1.3-kb dnrJ, and 0.5-kb Ermp. B pLMX-3-86 (8.3 kb). After restriction digestion with Xba I/EcoR I, two fragments appeared: 6.5-kb pKC1139 and a 1.8-kb fragment. C pLMX-3- 92 (9.2 kb). After restriction digestion with Xba I/Hind III, two fragments appeared: 8.3-kb pLMX-3-86 and 0.9-kb snogI- R. D Plasmid construction of pLMX-3-96. E Restriction map of pLMX-3-96. Lane: 1.
