Figure 3 | Structure of BexX–CysO from A.orientalis. a, A ribbon diagram of the BexX–CysO heterotetramer generated using two-fold crystallographic symmetry. BexX9 and CysO9 are coloured in cyan and light brown, respectively. Secondary structural elements of BexX and CysO are coloured in blue and pink for a-helices, green and yellow for b-strands, and yellow and green for loops, respectively. The C-terminal tail (AVAGG) of CysO is highlighted in red. The helices a7 and a8 from BexX and BexX9 are labelled in pink and blue, respectively. b, Stereo view diagram of the superposition of CysO (pink) and ThiS (yellow). Secondary structural elements are labelled in black for CysO and red for ThiS. The two major insertions of CysO, 3101 and a2, are highlighted in green. c, Comparison of the A. orientalis BexX–CysO dimer and the Bacillus subtilis ThiG–ThiS dimer. Monomers are coloured in blue for BexX, pink for CysO, grey for ThiG and yellow for ThiS.
