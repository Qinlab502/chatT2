Figure 1 | Proposed mechanism for 2-thiosugar formation in BE-7585A biosynthesis. a, The active site lysine residue (Lys110)6,7 of BexX initially forms an imine bond with G6P (1) at the C1 position, which is isomerized first to a C1â€“C2 enamine and then a C2-ketone intermediate (2) (the carbon atoms are numbered). Subsequent nucleophilic attack by a sulphur donor (red) occurs at the C2 position of 2, resulting in the incorporation of a sulphur atom in the 2-thio-G6P (2SG6P) (3) product. One arrow indicates one step, and two arrows suggest multiple steps between the transformations. b, ThiG-catalysed thiazole phosphate biosynthetic pathway. c, Stereo view of BexX active site. The active-site side chains and the Lys 110-G6P intermediate are depicted as sticks, with the carbon atoms of the residues coloured in green and purple, respectively (and nitrogen in blue and oxygen in red). The Fo 2 Fc simulated annealing omit map of the Lys110-G6P intermediate contoured at 4s is shown in grey. Water molecules are shown as red spheres. The carbon atoms of G6P are numbered from C1 to C6. The dashed lines represent hydrogen bonding. Me, methyl.
