Figure 2. Organization of the benastatin biosynthesis gene cluster in Streptomyces sp. A2991200. Each arrow indicates the direction of transcription and relative sizes of the ORFs deduced from analysis of the nucleotide sequence. Black ORFs, minimal PKS and cyclase/aromatase genes; dark gray ORF, KSIII gene; hatched ORFs, putative oxidoreductase genes; light gray ORFs, SAM synthetase and methyl transferase genes; checked ORFs, probable regulatory and resistance genes; white ORFs, genes of unidentified function.
