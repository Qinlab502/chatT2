Fig. 1. Genetic organization of the upstream region of the Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239 aur1 cluster. Each arrow indicates the direction of transcription and the relative size of the gene. The black arrows correspond to the aur1 cluster genes; the grey arrows, to the aur2 cluster genes; and the hatched arrows, to the genes similar to those for Streptomyces linear plasmid replication, partitioning and telomere- binding proteins. For details regarding individual genes and their products, see Table 1 and Novakova et al. (2004, 2011). The thick bars below the map indicate the overlapping DNA fragments of the corresponding cosmids used for sequencing.
