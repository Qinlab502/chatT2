Fig. 4. PFGE analysis of Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM3239 DNA followed by Southern blot hybridization with an aur1C gene probe from the auricin cluster (Novakova et al., 2002) and a hrdD gene probe containing the chromosomally encoded hrdD gene, which encodes a homologue of sigma factor of RNA polymerase (Kormanec et al., 1992). The S lanes denote lambda ladders.
