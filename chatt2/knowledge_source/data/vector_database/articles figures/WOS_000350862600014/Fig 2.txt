Fig. 2. Activation of the silent pga gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. PGA64. (A) Organization of the pga gene cluster, the promoters of gene in black are the targets to monitor and genes in orange are the candidates for transcription analysis. (B) Analysis of the fermentation extracts by HPLC to identify different peaks, absorbance at 254 nm was monitored. *major product, #minor product. (C) Structure of gaudimycin D (1). (D) Real-time RT-PCR analysis of transcription levels of genes predicted in different operons. Fold changes of each transcript in the activated strain PGA64M12 relative to the non-mutated control strain. Triplicates were performed for each reaction.
