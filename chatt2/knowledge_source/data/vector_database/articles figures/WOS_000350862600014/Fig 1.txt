Fig. 1. Workﬂow of the reporter-guided mutant selection method (RGMS) used for activation of silent gene clusters. Key steps include: (A) analyzing a sequenced gene cluster to select a target promoter which is usually the promoter of the core structural gene-containing operon; (B) cloning the target promoter in front of the xylE-neo cassette to generate a reporter plasmid which was ectopically integrated into a host strain after transformation; (C) determining kanamycin resistance levels of the transformants and then subjecting to UV mutagenesis before inoculation on a properly elevated kanamycin concentration for the neo reporter, and ﬁnally spraying a solution of catechol onto colonies for the xylE reporter among which the yellow colored are called RGMS mutants; (D) fermentation analysis of the RGMS mutants along with the non- mutated control strains; (E) comparative metabolic proﬁling by HPLC to identify different peaks. *major product, #minor product; (F) elucidating the potential products by LC–MS and NMR measurements.
