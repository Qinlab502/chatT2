Figure 1 The binding of anthracyclines to DNA. A) Structure of the nogalamycin- DNA complex (PDB: 182D) reveals the intercalation of the anthraquinone aglycone  between DNA bases and positioning of the carbohydrate unit at 7-position in the  minor groove of DNA, B) Formation of methylene adducts of doxorubicin to double- stranded DNA.
