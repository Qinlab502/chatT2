Figure 5. Distribution of sponge-associated microorganisms found to produce antimicrobial compounds: (A) Bacteria and Fungi; (B) Bacterial genera; and (C) Fungal genera. Figure 5 was made based on the summary of the taxonomic afÔ¨Åliations of sponge-associated microbes (N = 272) that were found to produce antimicrobials.
