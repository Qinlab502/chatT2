Figure 4. IdentiÔ¨Åcation of biosynthetic information of heliquinomycins. (A). Biosynthetic gene clusters of griseorhodin A (grh) and heliquinomycins (hlq). Individual genes are labeled by their numbers or names above the arrows. Genes of grh gene cluster which are homologous to those of hlq are exhibited under the arrows. (B). Proposed biosynthesis of the heliquinomycins. (C). Proposed biosynthesis of the 2,6-dideoxy-3-O-methylhexopyranose sugar moiety of heliquinomycins.
