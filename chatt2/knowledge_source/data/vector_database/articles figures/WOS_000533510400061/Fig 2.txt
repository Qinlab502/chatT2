Figure 2. Neighbour-joining tree based on MLSA analysis of the concatenated partial sequences (2481 bp) from Ô¨Åve housekeeping genes (atpD, gyrB, recA, rpoB and trpB) of strain jys28T and related taxa. Only bootstrap values above 50% (percentages of 1000 replications) are indicated. Asterisks indicate branches also recovered in the maximum-likelihood tree. Bar, 0.01 nucleotide substitutions per site.
