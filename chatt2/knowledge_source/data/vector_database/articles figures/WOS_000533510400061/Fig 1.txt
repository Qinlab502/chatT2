Figure 1. Neighbour-joining tree showing the phylogenetic position of strain jys28T and related taxa based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. Asterisks indicate branches that were also found using the maximum-likelihood method. Numbers at branch points indicate bootstrap percentages (based on 1000 replicates); only values >50% are indicated. Bar, 0.002 substitutions per nucleotide position.
