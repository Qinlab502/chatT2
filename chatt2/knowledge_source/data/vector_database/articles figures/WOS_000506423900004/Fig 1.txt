Fig. 2. Pradimicin-IRD reduces clonal growth and leads to cell arrest during the G0/G1 phase. Colony formation after pradimicin-IRD treatment for 6 h and placement in drug-free media for an additional 7 days. Representative images of colony formation after con- trol (DMSO 0.05%), doxorubicin (1 μM) and pradimicin-IRD (1.25; 2.5 and 5 μM) treatment are illustrated (A). Bar graphs represent the number (B) and size (C) of colonies (mean ± SEM); ANOVA, one way, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test, **p < 0.001 ***p < 0.0001. Histograms represents subG1, G0/G1, S and G2/M cell popula- tions in DMSO – (0.05%), doxorubicin – (1 μM) and pradimicin-IRD-treated cells (1.25; 2.5 and 5 μM) (D). Bar graphs represent the percentage of subG1 cell population (E) and cell cycle distribu- tion among the entire viable cell popu- lation (excluding subG1 cells) (n = 4) (mean ± SEM); ANOVA, one way, fol- lowed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test, *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; # indicates parameters that are statistically sig- niﬁcantly diﬀerent from those of dox- orubicin-treated cells (p < 0.0001) (F). Apoptosis was detected by ﬂow cyto- metry in HCT 116 cells treated with doxorubicin (1 μM) and pradimicin-IRD (1.25 μM, 2.5 μM and 5 μM) for 48 h using V-FITC/7AAD staining method. Representative point graphs are shown for each condition; the upper and lower right quadrants (Q2 plus Q3) cumulatively contain the apoptotic (annexin population V + cells) (G). Annexin V positive HCT 116 cell percentages in doxorubicin (1 μM) and pradimicin-IRD (1.25 μM, 2.5 μM and 5 μM) treatments obtained by the 7AAD and annexin V-FITC la- belled ﬂow cytometry assay. Values expressed by mean and standard error of the mean (n = 3). The results are presented as mean ± SD of three in- dependent experiments; * (p < 0.01); ** (p < 0.0001), ANOVA test and Tukey post-test, all pairs were analyzed and statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences are indicated (H).
