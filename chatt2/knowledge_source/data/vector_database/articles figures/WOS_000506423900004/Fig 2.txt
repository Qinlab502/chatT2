Fig. 3. Pradimicin-IRD induces DNA damage, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis markers in HCT 116 cells. The heatmap illustrates the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of the BCL2, BCL2L1, BAX, BAK1, CCNA2, CCNB1, CCND1, CCNE1, CDKN1A and CDKN1B genes in HCT 116 cells after treatment with pradimicin-IRD (5 μM; mean; n = 3) or doxorubicin (1 μM; n = 1) for 48 h. Green and red indicate down and upregulated genes, respectively (A). Immunoblotting analysis for γH2AX, p21, phospho(p)-Rb, Rb, PARP-1, cleaved PARP-1, cleaved caspase3 and GAPDH of HCT 116 cells after incubation with DMSO (0.05%), doxorubicin (1 μM) and pradimicin-IRD (1.25; 2.5; and 5 μM) for 48 h (B). Pixel quantiﬁcation of γH2AX (C), p21 (D), cleaved caspase-3 (E), cleaved PARP 1 (F), and pRb (G) (n = 3; mean ± SEM); ANOVA, one way, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test, *p < 0.01; **p < 0,001; ***p < 0.0001.
