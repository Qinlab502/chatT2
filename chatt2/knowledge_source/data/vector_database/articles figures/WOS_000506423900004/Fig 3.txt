Fig. 4. Kinetics of pradimicin-IRD-induced DNA damage in HCT 116 cells. Immunoblotting of γH2AX and α-tubulin of HCT 116 cells after pradimicin-IRD (5 μM) treatment for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h (A). Bar graphs represent the quantiﬁcation of three independent treatments (mean ± SEM); Student’s t test, *p < 0.02, **p < 0.009 (B). Immunoﬂuorescence of γH2AX and DAPI in HCT 116 cells after incubation with DMSO (0.05%) and pradimicin-IRD (5 μM) for 48 h (C). Immunoblotting analysis for γH2AX, p21 and α-tubulin of HCT 116 TP53+/+, HCT 116 TP53 , HT-29, SW480, and Caco-2 cells after incubation with DMSO (0.05%), doxorubicin (1 μM) and pradimicin-IRD (1.25; 2.5; and 5 μM) for 48 h. Pixel quantiﬁcation of γH2AX and p21 (n = 3; mean ± SEM); ANOVA, one way, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test, *p < 0.01 (D).
