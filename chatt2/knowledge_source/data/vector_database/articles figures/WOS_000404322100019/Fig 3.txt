Figure 3. Red circles (●) indicate positions with 14% isotopic incorporation, derived from the PKS-II substrate malonyl-CoA, the blue circle (○) indicates 27% incorporation derived from glucose 1- phosphate, and the pink diamond (⧫) indicates 11% incorporation, arising from shuﬄing the isotopic label from C1 to C6 during glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. *Solvent signal (methanol-d4).
