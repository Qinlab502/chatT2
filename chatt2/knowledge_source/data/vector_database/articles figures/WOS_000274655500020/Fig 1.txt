Fig. 2 Induction of apoptosis  and DNA damage by cosmomy- cin D. a Time course analysis.  MRC5 (normal), XP12RO  (XPA) or XP4PA (XPC) cells  were treated with 0.1 (cid:1)g/mL of  cosmomycin D or doxorubicin  for 24–96 h. b Apoptosis induc- tion by diVerent cosmomycin D  doses. Cells were treated with  0.1–0.5 (cid:1)g/mL of cosmomycin  D for 96 h. c Inhibition of apop- tosis by the caspase inhibitor Z- VAD-FMK. Cells were pre- treated with 50 (cid:1)M of the broad  caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK  for 2 h and then with 0.1 (cid:1)g/mL  of cosmomycin D for 96 h. Sub- sequently, cells were harvested,  stained with propidium iodide  and apoptosis levels were as- sessed by quantiWcation of the  number of cells with Sub-G1  DNA by FACS. d Cosmomycin  D-induced DNA damage mea- sured by the comet assay. Cells  were treated with 0.1–0.5 (cid:1)g/mL  of cosmomycin D or 0.1 (cid:1)g/mL  of doxorubicin for 3 h, trans- ferred to glass slides, subjected  to electrophoresis and then  stained with ethidium bromide.  Subsequently, cells were ana- lyzed by Xuorescence micros- copy and scored according to tail  length. Error bars represent the  mean of 2–3 determinations  §SEM. *P < 0.05 compared to  control
