Fig. 5. Binding of Aur1R to the aur1PR3p promoter. (a) Detection of protein–DNA complexes by EMSA using a 0.04 ng 32P- labelled 266 bp DNA fragment comprising the aur1PR3p promoter (probe 2) with increasing amounts of purified His-tagged Aur1R. Lane 1, labelled DNA fragment in the absence of protein; lanes 2–6, 2, 5, 10, 15 and 15 mg, respectively, of the purified His-tagged Aur1R protein. Addition of 200 ng of the unlabelled 266 bp aur1PR3p promoter DNA fragment was used to demonstrate Aur1R binding specificity (lane 6). The arrows indicate the free DNA fragment and shifted fragments corresponding to the proposed complexes. (b) Similar EMSA with 20 mg cell-free extracts from S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 wild-type (wt) and S. aureofaciens aur1R-disrupted (Daur1R) strains grown in Bennet medium to the indicated time points that refer to the particular growth stages (Fig. 2a). Lane C, labelled DNA fragment in the absence of protein. (c) DNase I footprint of Aur1R binding to a 0.3 ng of 59 end-labelled 266 bp DNA fragment encompassing the aur1PR3p promoter (probe 2). The vertical bar indicates the positions of the Aur1R binding sites. Numbering is relative to the TSP of the aur1PR3p promoter. Lane 1, without His-tagged Aur1R protein; lanes 2 and 3, 30 and 75 mg, respectively, of purified His-tagged Aur1R protein. Lanes A and T represent G+A and C+T sequencing ladders, respectively (Maxam & Gilbert, 1980). All binding experiments were performed twice with independent sets of protein samples, giving similar results. (d) Nucleotide sequence of the S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 aur1PR2p and aur1PR3p promoter regions. The deduced protein products are given in the single-letter amino-acid code in the second position of each codon. The TSPs of the promoters are indicated by bent arrows. The putative ”10 and ”35 boxes of the promoters are in bold and underlined. The nucleotides that were protected from DNase I by Aur1R binding are shaded. The nucleotide sequence shown is a part of the sequence that has been deposited in GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. HQ003813.
