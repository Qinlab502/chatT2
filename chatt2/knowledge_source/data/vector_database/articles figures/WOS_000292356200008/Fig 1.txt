Fig. 1. (a) Physical map of the S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 chromosomal regions in the upstream part of the aur1 cluster (Novakova et al., 2002, 2005). The genes are indicated by arrows. Bent arrows indicate the positions and direction of transcription from the indicated promoters. The thin lines below the map represent DNA fragments (59-labelled at the end marked with an asterisk) that were used as probes in S1-nuclease mapping and binding experiments. (b) Alignment of Aur1PR2 and Aur1PR3 with the well-characterized SARP activators DnrI (Stutzman-Engwall et al., 1992) and ActII-ORF4 (FernaÂ´ ndez- Moreno et al., 1991). The predicted secondary structure for the SARP family (Wietzorrek & Bibb, 1997) of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain, indicating the HTH variant, is marked. Identical residues are highlighted in black; similar residues are shaded. The numbers refer to the nucleotide sequence deposited in the databases. Sequences were retrieved from GenBank and aligned using CLUSTAL_X.
