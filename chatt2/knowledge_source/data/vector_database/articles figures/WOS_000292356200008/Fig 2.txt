Fig. 2. (a) Growth curve of S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 wild-type strains in liquid Bennet medium. Each point represents the mean of three assays. The growth curves of Daur1R (Novakova et al., 2010a), Daur1PR2 and Daur1PR3 were similar. The time points used for bioassays, transcriptional analysis and preparation of cell-free extracts are indicated by arrows. (b) Analysis of auricin production in the wild-type and the aur1PR-disrupted S. aureofaciens strains by biochromatography assay. Ethylacetate extracts from S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 wild-type (WT), aur1PR2-disrupted (Daur1PR2), and aur1PR3-disrupted (Daur1PR3) strains grown to indicated time points in Bennet medium were resolved by TLC and overlaid with B. subtilis as described in Methods. The inhibition zone corresponds to auricin (Novakova et al., 2002). (c) HPLC analysis of auricin production by the S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 wild-type (WT), aur1PR3-disrupted (Daur1PR3) and complemented (Daur1PR3+pPM-aur1PR3) strains grown for 14 h in Bennet medium. The arrow indicates the mobility of auricin.
