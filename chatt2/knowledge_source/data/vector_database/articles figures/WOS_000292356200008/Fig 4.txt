Fig. 4. (a, b) High-resolution S1-nuclease mapping of the TSP for the aur1PR2p and aur1PR3p promoters in S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 wild-type (WT) and S. aureofaciens aur1R-disrupted (Daur1R) strains. The 59-labelled DNA fragments were hybridized with 40 mg RNA and treated with 120 U S1-nuclease. RNA was isolated from the cultures grown in liquid Bennet medium to the time points indicated, which corresponded to the different growth phases (Fig. 2a). E. coli tRNA was used as a control (lane C). (c) Control S1-nuclease mapping experiments with the same RNA samples and a DNA probe for the hrdBp2 promoter (Kormanec & FarkasovskyÂ´, 1993). The RNA-protected DNA fragments were analysed on DNA sequencing gels together with G+A (lane A) and T+C (lane T) sequencing ladders derived from the end-labelled fragments (Maxam & Gilbert, 1980). Thin horizontal arrows indicate the positions of RNA-protected fragments and thick bent vertical arrows indicate the nucleotide corresponding to the TSP. Before assigning the TSP, 1.5 nt was subtracted from the length of the protected fragment to account for the difference in the 39 ends resulting from S1-nuclease digestion and the chemical sequencing reactions. In every the same RNA preparations were hybridized in experiment, parallel with all of the probes. All S1-nuclease mapping experiments were performed twice with independent sets of RNA with similar results.
