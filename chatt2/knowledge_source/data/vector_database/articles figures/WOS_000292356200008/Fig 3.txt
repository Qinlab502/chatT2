Fig. 3. (a, b) High-resolution S1-nuclease mapping of the TSP for the aur1Ap and aur1Pp promoters in S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 aur1PR3-disrupted wild-type (Daur1PR3) strains. The 59-labelled DNA fragments were hybri- dized with 40 mg RNA and treated with 120 U S1-nuclease. RNA was isolated from the cultures grown in liquid Bennet medium to the time points indicated, which corresponded to the different growth phases (Fig. 2a). E. coli tRNA was used as a control (lane C). (c) Control S1-nuclease mapping experiments with the same the hrdBp2 promoter RNA samples and a DNA probe for (Kormanec & FarkasovskyÂ´, 1993). The RNA-protected DNA fragments were analysed on DNA sequencing gels together with G+A (lane A) and T+C (lane T) sequencing ladders derived from the end-labelled fragments (Maxam & Gilbert, 1980). All S1- nuclease mapping experiments were performed twice with independent sets of RNA with similar results. E. coli tRNA was used as a control (lane C).
