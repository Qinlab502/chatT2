Fig. 6. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of both halves (a, b) of the aur1PR3p promoter protected by Aur1R with the previously characterized Aur1R-dependent aur1Pp and aur1Rp promoters (Novakova et al., 2010a) and the autoregulatory element (ARE) consensus sequence of the Streptomyces c-butyrolactone autoregulator receptor proteins (Folcher et al., 2001). Identical residues are highlighted in black. Arrows indicate the position of the 22 bp inverted repeat sequence identified as a consensus sequence (ARE box) of the c-butyrolactone autoregulator receptor protein ArpA (Onaka & Horinouchi, 1997). M5A or C, R5A or G, W5A or T, Y5C or T, K5G or T.
