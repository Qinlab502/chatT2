Figure 1. (a) Structures of (−)-lomaiviticin A (1), (−)-lomaiviticin C (2), (−)-lomaiviticin aglycon (3), and (2S,2′S)-lomaiviticin A (4). (b) View of (−)-lomaiviticin A (1; pale blue) bound to d(GCTATAGC)2. The diazo nitrogen and carbon atoms are shown in royal blue and magenta, respectively. The light and dark red spheres correspond to A6H4′ and A14H1′, which are the aliphatic DNA hydrogen atoms closest to each diazo carbon (4.2 Å).
