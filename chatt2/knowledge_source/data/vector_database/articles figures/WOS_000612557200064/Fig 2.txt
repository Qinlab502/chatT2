Figure 4. Optimized (ωB97X-D/6-311G*) structures of (−)-lomaiviticin A (1) and (2S,2′S)-lomaiviticin A (4). (a) Perspective from the diazoﬂuorenes toward the carbohydrate residues. (b) Perspective from the top (or side for 4). The naphthoquinone and cyclopentadiene rings are shown in pale blue. The aminosugar residues are shown in black. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity.
