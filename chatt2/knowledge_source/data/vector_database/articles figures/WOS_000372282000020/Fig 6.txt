Fig. 6 High-resolution S1 nuclease mapping of the transcription start points for the sa14p, sa46p, sa52p and sa53p promoters in the S. aureofaciens CCM3239 wild-type (wt), S. aureofaciens aur1PR3- disrupted (Δaur1PR3) and S. aureofaciens aur1PR4- disrupted (Δaur1PR4) strains. The 5′-labelled DNA fragments were hybridised with RNA isolated from cultures grown in liquid Bennet medium to the time points indicated (these corresponded to different growth phases). E. coli tRNA was used as a control (lane C). The control S1 nuclease mapping experiment (bottom panel) used the same RNA samples and a DNA probe for the hrdBp2 promoter (Kormanec and Farkasovsky 1993). The RNA-protected DNA fragments were analysed on DNA sequencing gels together with G + A (lane A) and T + C (lane T) sequencing ladders derived from the end-labelled fragments (Maxam and Gilbert 1980). Thin horizontal arrows indicate the positions of RNA-protected fragments, and thick bent vertical arrows indicate the nucleotide corresponding to the transcription start point. Before assigning the transcription start point, 1.5 nucleotides were subtracted from the length of the protected fragment to account for the difference in the 3′ ends resulting from S1 nuclease digestion and chemical sequencing reactions. In the control experiment, the same RNA preparations were hybridised in parallel with all of the probes. All S1 nuclease mapping experiments were performed twice with independent sets of RNA, giving similar results
