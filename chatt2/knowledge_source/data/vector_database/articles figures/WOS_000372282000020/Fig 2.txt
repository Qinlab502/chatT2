Fig. 2 a Growth curve of the S. aureofaciens CCM3239 wild- type strain in liquid Bennet medium. The time points used for the TLC analysis of auricin production and transcriptional analysis are indicated by arrows. b Analysis of auricin production in the wild-type and three mutants by biochromatography. Ethyl acetate extracts from each strain grown in Bennet medium to the time points indicated were resolved by TLC and overlaid with B. subtilis as described in the BMaterials and methods^. The arrows indicate the inhibition zone corresponding to auricin (Kutas et al. 2013) and deglycosylated auricin intermediates. c HPLC analysis of auricin production by the S. aureofaciens CCM3239 wild- type (WT) and aur1TQSV-, sa59- and sa52-disrupted strains (Δaur1TQSV, Δsa59, Δsa52) grown for 14 h in Bennet medium (details described in the BMaterials and methods^). The arrows indicate the positions of peaks for auricin and deglycosylated auricin intermediates
