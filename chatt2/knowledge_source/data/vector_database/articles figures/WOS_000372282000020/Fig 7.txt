Fig. 7 Detection of Aur1PR3 and Aur1PR4-DNA complexed by EMSA using 5′ end-labelled DNA fragments comprising the sa13–sa14 and the sa52–sa53 intergenic regions with increasing amounts of purified His-tagged Aur1PR3 and Aur1PR4. Lane 1, a labelled DNA fragment in the absence of protein; lanes 2 to 5, 1, 3, 5 and 5 μg, respectively, of the purified His-tagged protein indicated. Addition of 200 ng of the unlabelled corresponding DNA fragment was used to demonstrate Aur1PR3 and Aur1PR4 binding specificity (lane 5). The arrows indicate the free DNA fragment and the shifted fragment corresponding to the proposed complex. All binding experiments were performed twice with independent sets of protein samples, giving similar results
