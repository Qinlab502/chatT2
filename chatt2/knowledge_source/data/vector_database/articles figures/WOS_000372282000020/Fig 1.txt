Fig. 1 Genetic organisation of the auricin aur1 cluster. Thick arrows denote the direction of expression and the size of the genes. Dark-grey arrows correspond to the auricin genes, hatched arrows to the proposed D-forosamine biosynthetic and attachment genes, light-grey arrows to the putative PKS and accessory genes, black arrows to the regulatory genes and white arrows to genes of other functions. For details regarding individual genes and their products, see Table 2. Bent arrows indicate the positions and directions of those promoters which have been identified
