Fig. 4 a Analysis of auricin production in the wild-type S. aureofaciens CCM3239 strain (WT) and three mutants by biochromatography. Ethyl acetate extracts from each strain grown in Bennet medium to the time points indicated were resolved by TLC and overlain with B. subtilis as described in the BMaterials and methods^. The arrows indicate the inhibition zone corresponding to auricin (Kutas et al. 2013) and deglycosylated auricin intermediates. b HPLC analysis of auricin production by the S. aureofaciens CCM3239 wild- type (WT), sa46- and sa53-disrupted strains (Δsa46, Δsa53) and the Δsa46Δsa53 double mutant grown for 14 h in Bennet medium (details described in the BMaterials and methods^). The arrow indicates the position of the peak for auricin
