Fig. 8 a DNaseI footprinting of Aur1PR3 and Aur1PR4 binding to the 5′ end-labelled DNA fragments comprising the sa13-sa14 (left) and the sa52-sa53 (right) intergenic regions. The vertical bar indicates the positions of the binding sites. The numbering is relative to the transcription start point of the given promoter. Lane 1 is without Aur1PR3 or Aur1PR4. Lanes 2 and 3 contain 30 and 60 μg, respectively, of purified His-tagged Aur1PR3 and Aur1PR4. Lanes A and T contain G + A and C + T sequencing ladders (Maxam and Gilbert 1980). All binding experiments were performed twice with independent sets of protein samples, giving similar results. b The nucleotide sequence
