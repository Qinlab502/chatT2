Fig. 3 (a, b) Cyclic and (c, d) square wave voltammograms at glassy carbon electrode of (aâ€“c) 0.03 mM chartreusin plus 0.03 mM dsDNA and (d) 0.03 mM chartreusin solutions in 0.10 M Bu4NPF6/DMSO. (a) Initial cathodic and (b) anodic scan voltammograms at a potential scan rate of 50 mV s(cid:3)1. (c, d) Potential scan initiated at +1.05 V in the negative direction; potential step increment 4 mV; square wave amplitude 25 mV, frequency 5 Hz. Semi-derivative convolution of cyclic voltammograms was performed to increase peak resolution.
