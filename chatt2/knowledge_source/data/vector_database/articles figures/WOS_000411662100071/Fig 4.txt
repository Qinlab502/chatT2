Fig. 4 shows the (a, b) cyclic and (c, d) square wave voltam- mograms of 1-modied glassy carbon electrodes immersed into 0.25 M aqueous potassium phosphate buﬀer at pH 7.4 (a, c) in the absence and (b, d) in the presence of dsDNA. The voltam- metric response chartreusin (1) diﬀers from that recorded in the lipophilic environment, being dominated by two successive essentially reversible one-electron couples at midpeak poten- tials of +0.57 V (AI/CI) and +0.80 V (AII/CII), accompanied by an apparently irreversible reduction process at (cid:3)0.40 V (CIII) and a cathodic shoulder (CIV) near the solvent discharge.
