Fig. 7 shows the cyclic voltammogram at glassy carbon electrode of an air-saturated solution of 1 in 0.10 M Bu4NPF6/ DMSO. In the absence of chartreusin (1), the reduction of dis- solved oxygen occurs via a reversible one-electron transfer yielding superoxide ion resulting in a couple of peaks (Cox/Aox) at an equilibrium potential of (cid:3)0.80 V.53,54 This process can be represented as:
