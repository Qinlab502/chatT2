Fig. 2 shows cyclic voltammograms at glassy carbon elec- trode of a 0.03 mM solution of chartreusin in 0.10 M Bu4NPF6/ (cid:3)1. In initial cathodic DMSO at a potential scan rate of 50 mV s scan voltammograms (Fig. 2a), reduction peaks at (cid:3)0.18 (C1) and (cid:3)0.75 V (C2) vs. Ag/AgCl appear, followed by a shoulder at ca. (cid:3)1.5 V (C3). The peaks C1, C2 are coupled, in the subsequent anodic scan, by weak oxidation counterparts at (cid:3)0.58 (A2) and +0.10 V (A1). On prolonging this scan, anodic peaks at +0.59 (A3) and +0.90 V (A4) are recorded. In initial anodic scan voltam- mograms (Fig. 2b), only the peak A4 remains well-deî„ƒned, thus denoting that this electrochemical process corresponds to the oxidation of the pristine chartreusin (1). This peak does not exhibit any cathodic counterpart at high scan rates, thus sug- gesting that the process A4 corresponds to an essentially irre- versible process. In contrast, the peak A3 is accompanied by (cid:3)1, thus sug- a cathodic one (C3) at scan rates above 500 mV s gesting that the electron transfer process is coupled with rela- tively slow chemical reactions. The peak A3 also appears when the potential is switched few mV past the peak C1, thus denoting that the species resulting from this cathodic process yields two competing oxidative pathways via processes A1 and A3.
