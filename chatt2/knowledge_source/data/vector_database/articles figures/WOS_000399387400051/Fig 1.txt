Fig. 1. Identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster for anisomycin (1) and functional analysis by gene deletions. (A) Bioactivity-guided high-throughput library screening for localizing the ani cluster. (B) Organization of the ani gene cluster. Each gene was deleted in-frame. (C ) Putative anisomycin biosynthetic route based on the accumulated intermediates in individual gene-deletion mutants.
