Figure 4. Consumption of 2 and Formation of Products in Reactions Carried Out to Completion at Different NADPH Concentrations (A) A typical proﬁle of a reaction producing the 12b-hydroxylated product 5 (B). Characteristically, the NADPH-dependent steps do not overlap, and the product is not formed before 2 (-) has been depleted as in the CabE/CabV, PgaE/PgaM (Kallio et al., 2011), and UrdE/UrdMred in vitro reactions. (B) A typical proﬁle of a reaction producing 8 (B). The two NADPH-dependent steps occur simultaneously, and the product is formed already during the conversion of 2 (-) as in the LanE/LanV in vitro reaction. See also Figure S3.
