Figure 6. Measured and Theoretical ECD Spectra of 5, 2, and 8 (A and B) Experimental (A) and predicted (B) ECD spectra for the 4aR,6S,12bS enantiomer of 5. (C and D) Measured (C) and calculated (D) ECD spectra for the 4aR,12bR enantiomer of 2. The calculated spectra were based on two molecules of 2, with one in a C-4-in conformation and the other in a C-4-out conformation. (E and F) Experimental (E) and predicted (F) ECD spectra for the 6R enantiomer of 8. Three molecules of 8 with two molecules having an equatorially disposed HO-6 group and the third containing an axially disposed HO-6 group were used in the calculations.
