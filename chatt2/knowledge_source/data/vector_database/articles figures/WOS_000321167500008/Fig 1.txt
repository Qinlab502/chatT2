Figure 1. Proposed Biosynthetic Pathway of KST (A) Localization of the cloned DNA region from Micromonospora sp. TP-A0468 as represented by two overlapping fosmids and organization of KST gene cluster. (B–E) Proposed model for type II PKS and PKS-associated modiﬁcation (B), NRPS and formation of the bicyclic amidine (C), glycosylation relative modiﬁcation (D), and deoxysugar pathway (E). Color coding indicates the genes for the anthracycline (blue), aminopyrrole (red), bicycled amidine (green), deoxy sugar (purple), and all other genes (black).
