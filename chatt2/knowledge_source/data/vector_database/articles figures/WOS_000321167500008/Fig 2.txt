Figure 2. Characterization the Genes Involved in the Biosynthesis of KST In Vivo (A) HPLC analysis of KST production at 423 nm: (I) KST standard, (II) wild-type Micromonospora sp. TP-A0468, (III) mutant TG1701 (DkstA6), (IV) TG1708 (DkstB1), (V) TG1709 (DkstC3), and (VI) TG1710 (DkstA12). (B) Structure elucidation of 3 from TG1708 (DkstB1) or TG1709 (DkstC3) and 5 isolated from mutant TG1710 (DkstA12). See also Tables S5 and S6 and Figures S1, S2, S7, S10, and S11.
