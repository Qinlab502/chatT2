Figure 2. Autophagy-inducing eﬀect of isarubrolone F (4). The levels of autophagy proteins P62, LC3B-II/I, ATG4a/b, ATG7, and ATG5 in HepG2 cells are displayed by Western blotting. GADPH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was used as a loading control. Isarubrolone C (1), isarubrolone E (3), isatropolone A (5), and isatropolone C (6) showed the same or very similar eﬀects on autophagy (Figure S59).
