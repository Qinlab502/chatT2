Figure 5. (A) Genetic organization of baikalomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (bai) from Streptomyces sp. IB 201691-2A. Region cloned in p13-8bai is shown below; (B) alignment of gene clusters responsible for biosynthesis of saquayamycin-type angucyclines from diﬀerent actinobacteria. Mean pairwise identity over all pairs in the column: green—100% identity; green–brown—at least 30% and under bai—baikalomycin gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. 100% identity; red—below 30% identity. IB201691-2A; sch—Sch47554/47555 gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. SCC-2136; gcn—grincamycin gene cluster from S. lusitanus SCSIO LR32; saq—saquayamycin gene cluster from S. nodosus ATCC4899; sqn—saquayamycin gene cluster from Streptomyces sp.
