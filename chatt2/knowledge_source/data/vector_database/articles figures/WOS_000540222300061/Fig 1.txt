Figure 1. Structures of an aglycone and deoxy sugars typical for the aquayamycin-type angucyclines. Carbon atoms of the aglycone and sugars (with ) are labeled according to IUPAC rules. The rings of the aglycone are indicated as A–D. The compound with R1 as a d-olivose is historically considered as a common “aquayamycin-type aglycone”.
