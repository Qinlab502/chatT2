Figure 6. Inhibitory activities of 1-4 against HIV-1 infection. HIV inoculated cells were treated  with serial dilutions of 1-4 up to a concentration of 50 µM and checked for effects on (A) anti- HIV activity and (B) cell viability. Compound effects were evaluated in LC5-RIC cells exposed  to  HIV-1LAI.  Shown  are  the  means  and  standard  deviations  (±SD)  of  three  independent  experiments with triplicates (n=3; m=3).
