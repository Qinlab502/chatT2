Figure 1. (A) Gene organization of the skt gene cluster. The red line indicates the part of the cloned  skt cluster and was used for heterologous expression within this study. NheI was used to excise the  cluster from genomic DNA. (B) General workflow for the direct cloning of skt by LLHR. pSET152  was used as the expression vector and integrated into the S. coelicolor genome for heterologous  expression. (C) Left: simulated restriction enzyme analysis of the captured cluster by pSET152  digested with BlpI (1), PstI (2) and PvuII (3). Right: authentic restriction enzyme analysis of the  captured  cluster  digested  with  above  restriction  enzymes.  For  details  on  DNA  fragment  sizes,  please see Figure S4 and Table S3. (D) HPLC-UV analysis of culture extracts from S. coelicolor
