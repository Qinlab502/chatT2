Fig. 3 Chromatogram of extract of S. carnosus M-40. 3a Peak numbers indicate the identified compounds and correspond to the following: germicidin A (5), germicidin B (6), and lobophorin B (7). The peaks corresponding to unidentified lobophorines (*) are also shown. The lower part of the figure represents U.V. absorption spectra of the identified molecules. 3b Chemical structures of secondary metabolites with biological activity identified in extracts of S. carnosus M-40
