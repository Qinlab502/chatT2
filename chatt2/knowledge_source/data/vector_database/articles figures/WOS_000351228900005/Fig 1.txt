Fig. 2 Chromatogram of extract of S. cyaneofuscatus M-27. 2a Peak numbers indicate the identified compounds and correspond to the following: daunomycin (1), cosmomycin B (2), maltophilin (3), and galtamycin (4). The peaks corresponding to unidentified anthracyclines (*) and unidentified maltophilin (**) are also shown. The lower part of the figure represents U.V. absorption spectra of the identified molecules. 2b Chemical structures of bioactive secondary metabolites identified in extracts of S. cyaneofuscatus M-27
