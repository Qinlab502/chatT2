Fig. 4 GCN B speciﬁcally bound to IDH1 in vitro. a Native PAGE of IDH1 incubated with different concentrations of GCN B or GCN-2a. The left picture was scanned with Typhoon to visualize ﬂuorescence signal corresponding to GCN B and GCN-2a, the right picture shows the same gel after silver staining. G6PD was loaded as a negative control. b Pull-down of wild-type IDH1 by the biotinylated probe GCN B-Biotin. Samples treated with GCN B-Biotin in the presence or absence of free GCN B were pulled down with streptavidin beads, separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with silver. The ﬁnal concentration of DMSO was 1%, Biotin-GCN B was 1 μM and free GCN B was 10 μM. c Docking of GCN B to IDH1 (dimer). d Thermal shift assay of GCN B-treated IDH1 and artiﬁcial mutants. Samples incubated with GCN B or DMSO were loaded into 10% PAGE gels and scanned after Coomassie staining. The relative gray intensity values were plotted, and Tm was calculated by Boltzmann sigmoidal ﬁtting. e Thermal stability of wild-type form of IDH1 and N271L, L120A, and S280C mutants incubated with indicated concentration of GCN B at 52 °C.
