Fig. 6 IDH1 is the cellular target protein of GCN B in NB4 cells. a Western blot analysis of the expression of IDH1 in eight cancer cell lines. b The correlation analysis of IDH1 expression and IC50 of the eight cancer cells to GCN B. r = 0.7520, P = 0.0314. c Intracellular NADPH/NADP ratio of NB4 cells with treatment of GCN B. NB4 cells were treated with DMSO, different concentrations of GCN B, or Menadione (as positive control) for 2 h. Samples were loaded into a 96-well plate and mixed with G6PD buffer containing PES and MTT. The absorbance at 560 nm was measured every 30 s for 10 min after the reaction initialized by adding G6P. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. d Effect of GCN B on cellular viability of NB4 cells when pretreated with NAC. Cells were pretreated with 2.5 mM NAC for 2 h and then IC50 of GCN B against NB4 cells was determined as described in “Materials and Methods”. e, f Apoptosis of IDH1 knockdown cell lines. e Cells were harvested 36 h after infection and stained with Annexin-V-PE for detection by ﬂow cytometry. f Growth curve of IDH1 knockdown cells. Cell growth was measured every day for a total of 4 days following cells seeding. Fluorescence values were normalized to the values at the day of seeding. ***P < 0.001. g, h Determination of apoptosis in IDH1 knockdown NB4 cells treated with NAC. NB4 cells were treated with 2.5 mM NAC for 24 h after shRNA infection, and then stained with Annexin-V-PE for detection by ﬂow cytometry (g) or subjected to Western blot (h). n = 3 biological replicates. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
