Fig. 2 GCN B-induced ER stress, ROS augmentation, and apoptosis. a mRNA levels of genes related to ER stress (ATF6, ATF4, CHOP, GADD34) in NB4 cells treated with the indicated compounds for 12 h. Values are the mean ± SD (n = 3). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. b Protein levels of the indicated ER stress markers in NB4 cells treated with 1.25 μM GCN B for the indicated time. c XBP-1 splicing was determined by RT-PCR. uXbp-1, unspliced forms of Xbp-1 mRNA; sXbp-1, spliced forms of Xbp-1. d Flow cytometry analysis of NB4 cells stained with H2-DCFDA incubated with indicated concentration of GCN B, 0.1% DMSO (as negative control) or 0.5 μM TBHP (as positive control) for 2 h. e Apoptosis of NB4 cells treated with GCN B by FACS. Cells were treated with DMSO, 0.3 µM GCN B, 0.6 µM GCN B, or 0.5 µM TG (as positive control) for 24 h and double stained with PI and Annexin-V-FITC before being loaded onto FACS ﬂow cytometer for apoptosis determination. f Western blot of apoptosis markers in NB4 cells treated with GCN B. Cells were treated with DMSO, 0.3 µM GCN B, or 0.6 µM GCN B for 24 h. Lysates from these cells were analyzed by Western blot for PARP, caspase-9, and caspase-3.
