Fig. 3 Bioinformatic analysis of RNA-seq data and 2-OG levels after GCN B treatment. NB4 cells were treated with 0.63 μM or 1.25 μM GCN B for 6 h before harvesting. Each treatment was performed in duplicate. a, c GSEA was performed to identify pathways that were perturbed by GCN B treatment. The top ﬁve most down- and upregulated gene sets from the Hallmark gene sets (h.all.v5.1.symbols) or Chemical and Genetic Perturbation sets (c2.cgp.v5.2.symbols) are shown. b, d Enrichment plots for the MTORC1 signaling gene set and the MIKKELSEN_ES_LCP_WITH_H3K4ME3 gene set. Genes annotated as mTOR signaling pathway components were upregulated while genes associated with histone methylation were downregulated after GCN B treatment. e GCN B decreased the intracellular 2-OG levels of NB4 cells. Each treatment condition was performed in sextuplicate (n = 6), and the experiment was repeated twice. f Cytotoxicity of GCN B against NB4 cells in the presence or absence of DMOG.
