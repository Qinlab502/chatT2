Fig. 9.  Electron-microscopic detection of internalized CA208 mAb in a high-level CEA-producing cell line, COLO  205. CA208 mAb was  detected in endocytotic vesicles of COLO  205  cells as weil as the cell surface (A1 and A2).  No  positive staining was  observed with nlgG  (B). CA208  mAb was not detected in  cell lines not producing CEA,  K-562 (C) or A549  (D).  S c a l e   b a r   =  1  l.tm
