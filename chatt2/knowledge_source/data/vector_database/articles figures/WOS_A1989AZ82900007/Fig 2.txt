Fig. 4. Cytostatic effect  of Cyt-S-CA208 conjugate on COLO 205  cells.  COLO 205 cells (2 x  104 cells/well) were incubated with test  samples  at  0.1  txM (A) or  1.0 IxM (B)  drug  equivalent  for 30-120  min.  After the unbound materials  had been removed by washing,  cells  were  cultured  at  37°C  for  18h,  and  pulse-labeled  with  [3Hlthymidine  for 6 h  before  harvesting.
