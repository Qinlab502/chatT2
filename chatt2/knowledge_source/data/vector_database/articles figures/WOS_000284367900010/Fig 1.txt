Fig. 4. In vitro transcription experiments with Bacillus subtilis RNAP. Multiround in vitro transcription assay using templates carrying different bmrA promoter sequences and B. subtilis RNAP. Reactions were performed in a Ô¨Ånal volume of 10 mL in vitro transcription buffer (40 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM MnCl2, 50 mM EDTA, 50 mM KCl, 0.05 g L(cid:2)1 bovine serum albumin, 2.5% glycerol, 2 mM dithiothreitol) in the presence of 1 mM ATP, 0.1 mM CTP and GTP, 0.01 mM UTP and 0.011 mM [a-32P]UTP. Double-stranded DNA template (100 nM) was added, followed by 100 nM of RNAP. The reaction was gently mixed and incubated for 30 min at 37 1C. One volume of formamide loading dye was added, followed by denaturation for 5 min at 90 1C, quick cooling on ice and analysis on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was performed at 300 V/25 mA for 50 min. The following templates were used: WW, wild type; MW, single mutant in (cid:2) 35 region; WM, single downstream mutant; MM, double mutant as in strain 8R. The bmrA transcript is indicated by an arrow.
