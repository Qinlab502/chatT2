Figure 1. A cell-based screen to discover novel autophagy regulators from microbial secondary metabolites. (A) Structure of dutomycin (DTM). (B) Cervical cancer HeLa cells were treated with various concentrations of DTM for 3 or 24 h. Cell viability was evaluated using the EZ-Cytox cell viability assay kit (mean ± SD, n = 3). (C and D) Cells stably expressing EGFP-LC3B were treated with various concentrations of DTM for 3 h or 1 μM DTM for the indicated times. The cells were observed under a laser scanning confocal microscope. Torin 1 (100 nM) was used as a positive control. Scale bar = 10 μm. (E and F) Cells were treated with various concentrations of DTM for 3 h or 1 μM DTM for the indicated times, and conversion of LC3B−I to LC3B−II was determined by Western blot analysis (mean ± SD, n = 3). (G) Cells were treated with 1 μM of DTM for 3 h and imaged by transmission electron microscope (TEM). The white arrows and black arrows indicate cup-shaped isolation membranes or phagophores and autolysosomes, respectively. Scale bars = 1 μm, 0.5 μm, or 0.2 μm.
