Figure 5. Inhibitory eﬀects of DTM on the function of SERPINB6. (A) Intracellular serine protease activity in DTM-treated HeLa cells was measured with a SR101 FLISP SFCK serine protease assay kit. Staurosporine (Stau; 1 μM) was used as a positive control (mean ± SD, n = 4; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001). (B and C) Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of DTM for 3 h in the presence or absence of PI cocktail. The expression level of LC3B−II was determined by Western blot analysis, and cell viability was measured with the EZ-Cytox cell viability assay kit (mean ± SD, n = 3; ***P < 0.001). (D) Cells were treated with DTM (1 μM) for 3 h in the presence or absence of protease inhibitor cocktails (PI), Pefabloc SC (Pefa; 250 μM), E-64d (2.5 μg/mL), or pepstatin A (peps A; 5 μg/mL) as indicated. The conversion of LC3B−I to LC3B−II was determined by Western blot analysis (mean ± SD, n = 3; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001). (E) Cells were treated with DTM (1 μM) in the presence or absence of Pefa for the indicated times, and protein expression levels were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against mTOR, phospho-mTOR, and LC3B.
