Figure 3. DTM induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in HeLa cells. (A and B) Cells were treated with various concentrations of DTM for 24 h or DTM (2 μM) for the indicated times. Level of cleaved caspase-9 was analyzed by Western blot. Nocodazole (Noc; 100 nM) was used as a positive control (mean ± SD, n = 3). (C) Cells were incubated with DTM (5 μM) or DMSO (vehicle control) for 6 h. Apoptotic cells were stained with Annexin V and analyzed using ﬂow cytometry.
