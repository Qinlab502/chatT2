Figure 7. DTM inhibits human cancer cell progression in zebraﬁsh xenograft model. (A) Schematic diagram of the zebraﬁsh embryo xenograft model for human cancer cell progression. (B) HCT-15 cells were treated with DTM (1 μM) or DMSO (vehicle control) for 3 h, and conversion of LC3B−I to LC3B−II was determined by Western blot analysis. The level of LC3B−II was quantiﬁed with ImageJ software, and the relative protein levels were normalized to β-actin (mean ± SD, n = 3; ***P < 0.001). (C) Cells were incubated with diﬀerent concentrations of DTM for 3 or 24 h. Cell viability was measured with the EZ-Cytox cell viability assay kit (mean ± SD, n = 3). (D) Representative ﬂuorescent confocal images and a merged DIC of CM-DiI-labeled cells (red) grafted into zebraﬁsh embryos. Fluorescent cancer cells were observed at 1 and 4 dpi and then quantiﬁed with ImageJ software. Relative tumor area was expressed as means ± SD (n = 20 embryos/group; ***P < 0.001). (E) Schematic representation of DTM-induced autophagy and apoptosis by targeting SERPINB6.
