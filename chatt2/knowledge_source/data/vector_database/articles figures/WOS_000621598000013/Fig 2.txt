Figure 2. DTM induces autophagic ﬂux in HeLa cells. (A) Cells were treated with DTM (1 μM) or DMSO (vehicle control) in the presence or absence of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ; 10 μM) for 3 h. Levels of p62 and LC3B were analyzed by Western blot. Torin 1 (100 nM) was used as a positive control (mean ± SD, n = 3; *P < 0.05). (B) Cells stably expressing mRFP-EGFP-LC3B were incubated with DTM (1 μM), HCQ (10 μM), or Torin 1 (100 nM) for 3 h, followed by staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; blue). The colocalization of GFP-LC3B and RFP-LC3B puncta was observed under confocal microscopy. Scale bar = 10 μm. (C) Cells stably expressing EGFP-LC3B were treated with DTM (1 μM), HCQ (10 μM), or Torin 1 (100 nM) for 3 h and then immunostained with LAMP-1 antibody. The colocalization of EGFP-LC3B and LAMP-1 was examined using confocal microscopy. (D) Cells stably expressing EGFP-LC3B were preincubated with DQ-Red BSA (10 μg/mL) and then treated with DTM (1 μM) or HCQ (10 μM) for 3 h or starved in EBSS for 2 h. The cells were imaged with confocal microscopy. (E) Cells were treated with DTM (1 μM) for the indicated times, and protein levels were analyzed by Western blot analysis using antibodies against mTOR, p-mTOR, p70S6K, p-p70S6K, and LC3B (mean ± SD, n = 3; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001).
