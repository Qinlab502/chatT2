Figure 6. Knockdown and overexpression of SERPINB6 aﬀects autophagy in DTM-treated HeLa cells. (A) Cells were transfected with SERPINB6 siRNA (siSERPINB6) or scrambled siRNA (scRNA) for 48 h. Western blot analysis was performed using SERPINB6 and LC3B antibodies (mean ± SD, n = 3; *P < 0.05). (B) The SERPINB6 knockdown cells stably expressing mRFP-EGFP-LC3B were observed under a laser scanning confocal microscope. Scale bar = 20 μm. (C) The SERPINB6 knockdown cell viability was measured with the EZ-Cytox cell viability assay kit (mean ± SD, n = 3; ***P < 0.001). (D) Cells stably expressing SERPINB6-GFP were incubated with DTM (1 μM) for 3 h. Expression of SERPINB6 and the conversion of LC3B−I to LC3B−II were analyzed using Western blot (mean ± SD, n = 3). GFP-tag stably expressing cells were used as a control (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01). (E and F) Cells stably expressing SERPINB6-GFP or GFP (control) were treated with the indicated concentrations of DTM, and cell viability or intracellular serine protease activity was examined by Western blot analysis or a ﬂuorescence microplate reader, respectively. Staurosporine (Stau; 1 μM) was used as a positive control (mean ± SD, n = 3; ***P < 0.001).
