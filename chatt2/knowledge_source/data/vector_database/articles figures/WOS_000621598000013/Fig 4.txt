Figure 4. Target identiﬁcation of DTM through the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and drug aﬃnity responsive target stability (DARTS). (A) HeLa cell lysates were incubated with DTM (500 μM) or DMSO (control) for 1 h and heated for 5 min at 55 °C. The eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and detected by silver staining. The stabilized protein bands (black arrow) for DTM were identiﬁed using LC−MS/MS. (B) Cell lysates were incubated with DTM (50 μM) or DMSO (control) for 1 h. CETSA and DARTS techniques were performed, and soluble proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis to detect SERPINB6. β-actin was detected as a protein loading control. (C) SPR analysis of the binding kinetics between DTM and SERPINB6. (D) Recombinant SERPINB6 and cathepsin G (CTSG) were incubated with the indicated concentrations of DTM for 1 h. The level of SERPINB6 was analyzed by Western blot. (E) The eﬀect of DTM on the enzyme activity of CTSG in the presence of SERPINB6 was monitored using time-course kinetics.
