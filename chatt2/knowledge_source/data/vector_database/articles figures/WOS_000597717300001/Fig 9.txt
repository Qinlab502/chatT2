Figure 10. The PRM-A torsion profile elaborates on the conformational changes of the rotatable bond of ring A and ring B which attaches to the D-Alanine and Disaccharide moiety, respectively, the 100 ns simulation trajectory. The rotatable bond torsion is elucidated by a bar plot and a dial plot of similar color. Dial plots show the conformational variations of the torsion during the 100 ns MD simulation.
