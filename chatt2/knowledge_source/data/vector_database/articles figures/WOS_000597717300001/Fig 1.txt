Figure 2. Binding mode of PRM-A with N-linked glycans of SARS CoV-2 spike glycoprotein: (a) 2D interaction diagram of PRM-A with glycan; (b) 3D intermolecular interaction between PRM-A and N-linked glycans of SARS CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. The SARS CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is shown in the ribbon form, PRM-A has been shown in ball and stick model and Glycans are shown in wireframe. GlcNAc, Man and Fuc are represented in blue, green and red color, respectively.
