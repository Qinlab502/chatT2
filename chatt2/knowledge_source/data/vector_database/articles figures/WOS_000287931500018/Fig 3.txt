Fig. 5 Enzymatic total synthesis of TDP-D-ravidosamine. Trace a: Thymidine monophosphate (TMP, 23) incubated with acetate kinase (ACK), thymidine monophosphate kinase (TMK) and adenosine triphos- phate (ATP), 24 = TDP, 25 = TTP; trace b: assay mixture of trace a incu- bated with glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P) and RavD, 9 = TDP-D-glucose; trace c: assay mixture of trace b supplemented with RavE, 10 = TDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose; trace d: assay mixture of trace c sup- plemented with RavIM, RavAMT, L-glutamate and pyridoxal-phosphate (PLP), 15 = TDP-3-amino-3,6-dideoxy-D-galactose; trace e: assay mix- ture of trace d supplemented with S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and RavNMT, 17 = TDP-D-ravidosamine. Reactions were carried out for 1 h prior to the HPLC analyses. The compounds on the HPLC traces for a, b, c and d remained unchanged when the commercial TTP was used in place of the TTP generated in situ by ACK, TMK, acetyl phosphate, TMP (23) and ATP. The peaks with numbers 9, 10, 15, 17, 23, 24 and 25 represent TDP-D-glucose, TDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose, TDP-3-amino-3,6-dideoxy-D-galactose, TDP-D-ravidosamine; TMP, TDP and TTP, respectively. The peak marked with an asterisk was not charac- terized, as its UV spectrum did not indicate a thymidine chromophore. SAM represents S-adenosyl methionine.
