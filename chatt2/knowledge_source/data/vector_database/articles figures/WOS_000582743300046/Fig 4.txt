Fig. 7. The F1025Y/R1128G mutations map to the Top2 C-gate. (A) Cartoon representation of a full-length, nucleotide-bound S. cerevisiae Top2 dimer bound to a cleaved DNA segment (Protein Data Bank ID 4GFH) (46). One subunit is colored in dark hues and the other in light hues. Dark/light or- ange: ATPase domains; dark/light red: TOPRIM Mg2+-binding domain; dark/ light blue: principal DNA-binding region; dark/light green: C-gate; dark purple: cleaved DNA. AMPPNP is shown as cyan spheres; the locations of F1025 and R1128 are marked as magenta spheres. (B) Close-up of the region around F1025 is highlighted, with F1025 shown in magenta. (C) Close-up of the region around R1128, illustrating the packing of this residue adjacent to W1122 at the dimer interface.
