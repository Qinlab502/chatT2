Fig. 2. Biochemical activities of WT and mutant proteins. Top2 proteins were expressed from the pGAL1 promoter in the top1Δ strain JELt1 (29), and 200 ng of negatively supercoiled pUC18 DNA was used in all reactions. (A) DNA strand-passage activity of purified WT, Top2-R1128G, and Top2-FY,RG proteins; the amount of protein (ng) is indicated above each lane. (B) DNA cleavage activity of WT and mutant Top2 proteins; the positions of nicked (N), linear (L), and supercoiled (SC) pUC18 are indicated. DNA cleavage is quantitated in SI Appendix, Fig. S1. (C) DNA cleavage activity of WT and mutant Top2 proteins in the presence of etoposide; etoposide concentration (μg/mL) is indicated above each lane. Data in the presence of mAMSA are in SI Appendix, Fig. S2.
