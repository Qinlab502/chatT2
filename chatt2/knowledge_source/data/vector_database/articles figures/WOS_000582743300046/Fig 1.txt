Fig. 1. Genetic characterization of top2 mutants. (A) The top2-4 host strain, JN362at2-4 (30), was transformed with pDED1Top2 plasmids containing the indicated alleles. Transformants were grown to midlog phase in SC-Ura medium at 34 °C, and the indicated concentration of etoposide was added. Incubation was continued for an additional 24 h before plating cells for survival. The survival plotted is relative to that at the time of etoposide addition. Error bars are ± SEM. (B) The pGAL-Rad52 plasmid (32) was transformed into a top2-4 rad52Δ background (JN332at2-4), and then cells grown in galactose medium were transformed with pDED1Top2 containing the indicated allele. Transformants were selected on uracil-deficient medium containing either glucose or galactose as a carbon source. (C) Diploid strain CG2009 was transformed with the relevant plasmid and grown selectively in SC/peptone-Ura medium prior to plating on drop-out media (SC/peptone) to select recombinants. Error bars are 95% confidence intervals. (D) YMM10t2-4, a top2-4 derivative of YMM10 (33), was transformed with the pDED1Top2 or pDED1Top2-FY,RG plasmid containing an HA-tagged allele. Transformants were grown in the presence or absence of 200 μg/mL etoposide prior to ge- nomic DNA isolation using the yeast ICE protocol. After DNA recovery, quan- titation, and digestion with miccrococcal nuclease, DNA-associated proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE, and Top2 was detected using an anti-HA or anti- TOP2 antibody. Survival data following 24 h growth in the presence of mAMSA are shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S2. (E) Top2 and Top2-FY,RG levels relative to tubulin are shown.
