Fig. 7 Suggested coupled action of GilM, quinone reductase and O-methyltransferase, and GilR, lactol dehydrogenase, through co- factor sharing. The FAD co-factor is covalently embedded in GilR (see Fig. 9), but its reduced form has to be utilized by GilM and thereby recycled for the next round of GilR catalysis. Since the GilGT step hap- pens in between, GilGT likely also partakes in this enzyme complex.
