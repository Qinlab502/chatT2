Fig. 17 PKS and post-PKS enzyme complexes assemble and guide the progressing pathway intermediates towards the membrane channel, where the final product mithramycin is formed and out-transported. For colors symbolizing the enzymes see pervious figures. The figure- 8 loop of substrate/product flow within the trisaccharide forming 5-enzyme complex is shown as thin black line.
