Fig. 1 Typically envisioned, but here simplified biosynthetic pathway of a bacterial aromatic polyketide, doxorubicin, consisting of a type II PKS complex and a group of unattached, standalone post-PKS tailoring enzymes.16 Not shown are, for example, later occurring oxygenase (OX) catalyzed steps. The pivotal glycosyltransferase (GT) catalyzed steps typically occur late in such pathways.16
