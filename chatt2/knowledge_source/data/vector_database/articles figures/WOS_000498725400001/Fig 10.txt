Fig. 11 A. Interplay between ketoreductase/methyltransferase MtmC and glycosyltransferase MtmGIV. The interdependence of these two unusual, multifunctional enzymes along with the fact that three enzymes catalyze two reactions in between and one immediately after the MtmC/GIV reactions led to the postulate that it is a 5-enzyme complex that establishes the trisaccharide chain of mithramycin. How MtmGIII and MtmMII interact with MtmC/GIV and prepare the pair for the second round of catalysis remains to be investigated. B. When TDP-keto-D-olivose is treated with MtmC and SAM, in absence of MtmGIV, the sugar donor substrate is unstable and the activating TMP group eliminated.
