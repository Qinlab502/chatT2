Fig. 10 The presumed PKS complex of the mithramycin pathway (top left box) and intermediates of the post-PKS pathway, with premithramycin- one, premithramycin B and mithramycin DK being key intermediates. Three enzyme complexes (two of those in shaded boxes) catalyze the three post-PKS events leading to mithramycin, the two side chains (red framed) and the oxidative rearrangement leading to the multifunctional C5-side chain (red). Minimal PKS = black/grey, cyclases = blue, ketoreductases = white, methyltransferases = pink or purple, oxygenases = red, glycosyltransferases = olive or variants of green, ABC transporters = yellow.
