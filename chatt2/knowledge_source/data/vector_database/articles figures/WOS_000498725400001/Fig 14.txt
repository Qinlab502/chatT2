Fig. 15 Crystal structures of MtmOIV and MtmW. A. A monomer of MtmOIV in complex with premithramycin B and FAD (PDB: 4K5S).14 A. Only one monomer of the homodimeric MtmOIV is shown. The FAD binding, middle and C-terminal domains are colored beige, turquoise and grey, respectively. The FAD and premithramycin B (PreB) are colored purple and orange, respectively. B. An octamer of MtmW. A channel along the four-fold rotational symmetry axis may be an extension of a transmembrane channel used the bacterium to secrete mithramycin or transport ions. The MtmW structure is unpublished.14,53
