Fig. 12 Crystal structures of MtmC. A. The structure of the MtmC-SAH-TDP-4-keto-D-olivose (TDP-KOL) complex (PDB ID: 4RVH),52 B. the model of the MtmC-NADPH-TDP-KOL-complex. The co-substrates are shown in purple, the flexible loop with the crucial Tyr-79 residue is depicted in black, the TDP-KOL substrate in orange. The N-terminal, central and C-terminal domains are colored beige, turquoise and grey, respectively.
