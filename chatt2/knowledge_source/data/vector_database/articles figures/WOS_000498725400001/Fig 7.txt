Fig. 8 Crystal structure of GilR (A, α-helices = red, β-sheets = yellow, loops = green).41 B: The FAD cofactor, black, is bis-covalently linked via His- 65 and Cys-125, the catalytically important Tyr residues 139, 445, and 448 are shown in red. Panel C shows substrate pregilvocarcin V sandwiched between the co-factor and the Tyr residues.41 Panel D shows the dimeric form of GilR with FAD (colored) in the active site. The scheme below (panel E) explains how the Tyr residues support the FAD-reduction (hydrogenation).
