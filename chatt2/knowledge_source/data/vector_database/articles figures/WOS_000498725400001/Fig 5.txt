Fig. 6 Studies with GilOII revealed FADH-dependence and its consec- utive double action. The 5-hydroxylation steers the Baeyer–Villiger (BV) oxidation towards the correct C–C-bond cleavage (CHOH > arene mi- gration). The oxepine intermediate (blue, framed in red) could be iso- lated and characterized by MS and NMR, proving the BV mechanism over an alternative dioxygenase (via dioxetane) mechanism. Assays (green frame) shows FADH dependence of GilOII, and that GilOII is also needed for the ring opening. Traces: A = dehydrorabelomycin + GilOII + NADPH + FAD + Fre; E = dehydrorabelomycin + JadG + NADPH + FAD + Fre; D = positive control = dehydrorabelomycin + GilOII, GilM, GilMT, GilR + co-factors. B and C = negative controls, either with GilOII alone, no co-factors (B) or with GilOII and all co-factors except FAD (C).24,26 Flavin reductase (Fre) regenerates FADH2 while JadG is the jadomycin pathway equivalent of GilOII.
