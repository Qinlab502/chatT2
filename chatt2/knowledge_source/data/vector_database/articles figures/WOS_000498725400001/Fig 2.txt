Fig. 2 Examples of members of the gilvocarcin type family of anticancer drugs (panel A, right), the gilvocarcin (gil), ravidomycin (rav) and chrysomycin (chry) gene clusters in comparison, (panel A, left), a cartoon of the mode-of-action (panel B) and a producing strain gilvocarcin, Strep- tomyces griseoflavus (panel C).24,28 Note that the R and M activities are encoded by a single gene in the rav and chry gene clusters, and the co- location of the MT, OII, R- and M genes in all three clusters. PKS cluster = black, deoxysugar biosynthesis and glycosyltransfer = green, oxidizing enzymes = red, methyl transfer = turquoise, regulation and resistance = grey, unknown (at sequencing time) = white.
