Figure 1. A) Network analysis showing homology between the type II PKS BGCs present in 50 of the 99 analyzed Nocardia genomes.  Networks are individually color coded with unique BGCs in green. Triangles represent known gene clusters. Circles represent BGCs derived  from genomes in GenBank, while squares indicate BGCs identified from in-house sequenced Nocardia genomes. Circles or squares having  black borders indicate human pathogenic strains, while those with no border are environmental strains. B) Phylogenetic position of CLF  proteins from Nocardia type II PKS BGCs compared with a set of known gene clusters (see Materials and Methods for further detail). Circles  or squares at branch tips have the same meaning as in part A of the figure. Likewise, circles, squares and triangles are color-coded as for part  A of the figure. Shaded blocks on the outside of the tree show predicted product of each CLF. A labelled version of the tree appears as  Supplementary Figure 1.
