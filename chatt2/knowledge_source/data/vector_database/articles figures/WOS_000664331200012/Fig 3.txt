Figure 3. Functional analysis of med-8 involved in the biosynthesis of MED 1. (A) Pigmentation of MED-related Streptomyces variants on the solid medium. (B) Chromatogram at UV absorbance of 420 nm. The native producing strain AM-7161 produces MED 1, KAL 4, and DHK 6.29 In CH999/pIK340, an accumulation of MED 1 can be detected.14 The host CH999 did not produce any PNQ-related compounds, as a negative control. In the med-8-deﬁcient strain CH999/pHSL3, the production of MED 1 was completely abolished, and a PNQ-aglycone KAL 4 and related metabolites DHK 6, 4R-AcCys-DHK 7, and 4S-AcCys-DHK 8 were accumulated (Figure 5 for their structures).22−25,28 In the complementary strain CH999/(pHSL3+pHSL5), the production of MED 1 was restored at the presence of med-8.
