Figure 1. Proposed biosynthetic pathways of MED 1 and ACT 2. A common intermediate, (S)-DNPA 3, is hydroxylated at C-6 by a two- component ﬂavin-dependent monooxygenase system Med-7/Med-1314,19−21 or ActVA-5/ActVB,22−24 and this is followed by an auto-oxidization to aﬀord DHK 6, further to KAL 4. Synthesis of NDP-ANG 5 from glucose by six ANG med genes and transfer into C-10 of KAL 4 by Med-8 were proposed to occur in the last step in the MED 1 pathway.14,20−22,24,28
