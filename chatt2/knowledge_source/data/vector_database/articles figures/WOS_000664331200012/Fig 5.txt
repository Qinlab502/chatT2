Figure 5. Feeding PNQ-compound KAL 4 into the glycosylation cassette (CH999/pAYT55). (A) Chromatogram at UV absorbance of 420 nm. CH999/pAYT55 fed with DMSO acted as a negative control. CH999/pAYT55 fed with KAL 4 resulted in the production of a glycosylated product DHM 9, while CH999 fed with KAL 4 as another negative control showed the conversion of KAL 4 completely into DHK 6 (dihydro- form of 4) at the absence of pAYT55. Feeding CH999/pAYT55 or CH999 with KAL 4 also led to the conversion of KAL 4 into 4R-AcCys-DHK 7 and 4S-AcCys-DHK 8. See Figure S7 for the details about the production of 7 and 8 and Figures S7 and S9 for the details about the production of DHM 9 as well as the conversion of puriﬁed DHM 9 into MED 1. (B) The proposed pathway of the C-glycosylation of MED 1 and DHM 9 from KAL 4 using pAYT55. NDP-angolosamine (sugar donor, 5) and KAL 4 (proposed sugar acceptor) were proposed to be linked together through a C−C bond by Med-8 in the wild-type strain AM-7161, while KAL 4 supplemented into CH999/pAYT55 was converted in vivo into DHK 6 ﬁrst and further into DHM 9 at the presence of pAYT55. DHM 9 was lactonized spontaneously in vitro into MED 1 (see Figure S9).
