Figure 4. Coexpression of angolosamine biosynthetic and transfer genes from med cluster in the heterologous host CH999. (A) Angolosamine biosynthetic genes med-14, -15, -16, -17, -18, and -20 and transfer gene med-8 were reorganized and ligated into an integrative vector pSET152,39 generating pAYT55. The expression of this glycosylation cassette was controlled by PactIII-actI. (B) After pAYT55 was introduced into CH999, angolosamine biosynthetic and transfer genes were conÔ¨Årmed to express heterologously under the control of PactIII-actI. The housekeeping gene hrd was used as an internal reference.
