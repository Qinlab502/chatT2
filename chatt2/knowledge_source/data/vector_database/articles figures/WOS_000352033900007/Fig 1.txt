Figure 2. Phylogenetic diversity of environmental strains in follow-up coculture panel. The phylogenetic tree was constructed within the software package MEGA using the neighbor-joining method and implementing a maximum composite likelihood nucleotide substitution model.35,36 Nodes supported by bootstrap analyses (>70%) are indicated.37 The red circles indicate the strains that induced resistomycin production when cocultivated with strain B033. The black triangles are reference strains and were not directly part of this study. The percent of strains within each grouping that induced resistomycin production is shown to the right of the phylogenetic tree.
