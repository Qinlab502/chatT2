Fig. 3 Co-transcriptional and differential expression analyses of the txn gene cluster. a The txn cluster, including genes from txn0 to txn55, and the arrow indicating a promoter probably located within the intergenic region. b Co-transcriptional analysis by RT-PCR. The numbers in the parentheses mean the corresponding intergenic distance. Lanes 1 and 3 indicate cDNA products as the PCR template; lanes 2 and 4 indicate RNA as template; lane 5 indicates no PCR
