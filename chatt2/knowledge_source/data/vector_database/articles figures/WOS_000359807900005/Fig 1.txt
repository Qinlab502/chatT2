Fig. 2 Construction and fermentation product analysis of the txn regulatory gene mutants. a PCR veriÔ¨Åcation of the inactivation mutants. Lane M, DNA marker; lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 are txn9, 10, 11, 22, 34, and 48 mutants, respectively, and their PCR products of 1681, 1857, 1549, 1576, 1679, and 2015 bp, respectively; lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 are the wild-type txn9, 10, 11, 22, 34, and 48 genes, respectively, and their PCR products of 749, 1138, 541, 700, 855, and 1085 bp, respectively. b HPLC analysis of the txn mutant fermen- the wild-type trioxacarcin A producing strain tation products.
