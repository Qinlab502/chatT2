Fig. 1. Effect of heliquinomycin (HQ) on the incorporation of BrdU into DNA in HeLa cells. (A) Logarithmically growing HeLa cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of heliquinomycin for 1 h and then pulse labelled with BrdU for 20 min. The incorporated BrdU in the cells was detected by incubation of the cells with anti- BrdU Ig, followed by FITC-labelled anti-rat Ig. MCM7 was detected by incubation of the cells with anti-MCM7 Ig, followed by Cy3- labelled anti-mouse Ig. (B) One hundred Cy3-stained cells were selected, and the ﬂuorescence intensity of FITC in the cells was quantiﬁed. The average level of intensity in the cells cultured in the presence of heliquinomycin was expressed in comparison with that in the cells cultured in the absence of heliquinomycin.
