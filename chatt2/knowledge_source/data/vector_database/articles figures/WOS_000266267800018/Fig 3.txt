Fig. 5. Top: effect of increasing concentrations of heliquinomycin (HQ) on the ATPase activities of the MCM4/6/7 complex (340 ng) and the SV40 T antigen (200 ng) in the absence of single-stranded DNA. After incubation under these conditions, an aliquot of the mix- ture was subjected to thin layer chromatography. The radioactivity at the sites to which Pi and ATP migrated was measured, and the ratio of the released Pi to ATP was calculated. The ratio obtained in the case of the reaction performed without the enzymes was subtracted from that obtained in the reactions performed with the enzymes. Bottom: the ratio obtained in the case of the control reaction mixture which lacked heliquinomycin was considered to be 100%, and that recorded for the reaction mixture that contained heliquinomycin was presented in relation to this control value. Two independent experi- ments were performed for the MCM4/6/7 complex, and an average of the values was plotted together with error bars.
