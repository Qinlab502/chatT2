Fig. 4. Effect of increasing concentrations of heliquinomycin (HQ) on the formation of the MCM4/6/7 complex. The MCM4/6/7 com- plex was incubated in the presence or absence of heliquinomycin and subsequently electrophoresed on a native polyacrylamide gel. The proteins in the gel were transferred onto a ﬁlter and the MCM4 protein was detected by incubating the ﬁlter with rabbit anti-MCM4 IgG, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Finally, the bound antibodies were examined for chemiluminescence using West Pico chemiluminescent substrate IL, USA). The positions to which (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Rockford, thyroglobulin (669 kDa) and ferritin (440 kDa) migrated in the gel are indicated.
