Figure 1. Genetic organization of the mensacarcin biosynthetic gene cluster and cos2 (containing the didesmethylmensacarcin biosynthetic gene cluster). Genes encoding hypothetical proteins are shown in white; two genes encoding transposases are in light gray; regulatory genes are in dark gray; three genes encoding the three non-contiguous genes minimal PKS are in black; genes encoding oxygenases are striped; genes encoding cyclases are spotted; genes for SAM regeneration/ methylation are and chequered.
