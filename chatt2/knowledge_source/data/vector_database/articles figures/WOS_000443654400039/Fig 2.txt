Figure 3. Structures of ChaP and its homologous enzymes and proposed catalytic mechanism. The dimeric structure of ChaP (PDB: 6A4Z)  (A), ChaP-H1 (PDB: 6A52) (B), and ChaP-H2 (PDB: 6A4X) (C), (D) superimposed image of ChaP (wheat), and its homologs ChaP-H1  (yellow) and ChaP-H2 (aquamarine) and their symmetric monomer was marked as light gray. (E) Colored surface of ChaP and the putative  substrate position by docking. The molecular surface was colored by amino acid hydrophobicity according to the Kyte-Doolittle scale: the  hydrophobicity scale from least to most was colored blue to orange to red with zero hydrophobicity colored as white. (F) Amino acid residues  in ChaP that form the active site. Residues from two monomers were colored in gold and silver, respectively. (G) Proposed mechanism for  ChaP-catalyzed reaction.
