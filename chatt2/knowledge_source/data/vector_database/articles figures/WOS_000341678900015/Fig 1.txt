Fig. 1. Quantification of induction or repression of antimicrobial activity in actinomycetes against E. coli ET8 depending on the growth conditions. Numbers on the vertical axis represent growth conditions as listed in Table 1 and those on the horizontal axis represent the total number of actinomycetes whose antibiotic production was either induced or repressed under each of the 40 growth conditions. Strains were grown on MM agar plates with 0.5 % mannitol and 1 % glycerol as carbon sources, with or without additives, and then overlaid with top agar containing indicator strain E. coli ET8. Inhibition zones were then measured as zones of clearing. Only significant changes (changes of .1 mm and 10 % in diameter) in the size of the zones in all replicates of the triplicate experiment were considered.
