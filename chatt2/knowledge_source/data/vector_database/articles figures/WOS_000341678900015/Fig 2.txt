Fig. 2. Antimicrobial activity of eight actinomycetes against E. coli ET8 under five different growth conditions. Strains were grown on MM agar plates with 0.5 % mannitol and 1 % glycerol as carbon sources, with or without additives. 1, No additives; 2, 25 mM N-acetylglucosamine; 3, pH adjusted to 10; 4, starch (1 % w/v); 5, peptone (0.8 % w/v). The experiment served as a representative example of the inducibility of antibiotic production in actinomycetes, under the chosen conditions. For details on the effect of elicitors on the 96 strains, refer to Tables S1 and S4.
