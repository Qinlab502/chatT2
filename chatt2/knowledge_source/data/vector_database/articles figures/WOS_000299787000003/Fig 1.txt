Fig. 1 Effect of heliquinomycin on chromatin-binding of MCM4 in HeLa cells. (A) The logarithmically growing HeLa cells were incubated with indicated concentrations of heliquinomycin for 1 h and then pulse-labelled with BrdU for 20 min. After removal of chromatin-unbound proteins, the incorporated BrdU in cells were detected by incubation with anti-BrdU antibody and then with FITC-labelled anti-rat antibody, and MCM4 on chromatin was detected with anti-MCM4 antibody (Santa Cruz Bio., sc-22779) and then with Cy3-labelled anti-rabbit antibody. (B) One hundred cells were selected, and the ﬂuorescence intensity of FITC and Cy3 in those cells was quantiﬁed. The averaged level of the intensity in the cells cultured in the presence of heliquinomycin was expressed in comparison to that in the cells cultured in the absence of heliquinomycin. Two independent experiments were performed, and averages of the values were plotted with error bars.
