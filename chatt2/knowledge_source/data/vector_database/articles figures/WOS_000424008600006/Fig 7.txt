Figure 9. (a) and (b) Crystal structure of the SimC7 ternary complex with NADP+ and 7-oxo-SD8. The nucleotide-binding domain, the substrate-binding domain and the lid motif are shown in yellow, blue and magenta, respectively. NADP+ is shown in pink and 7-oxo-SD8 is shown in green. For the latter, only the crystallographically resolved atoms are shown, i.e. the angucyclinone, the olivose and roughly half of the tetraene linker. (c) Close-up showing the active site of the ternary complex including the Ser95-Ile108-His112 ‘catalytic triad’ residues, and Asn137, which is important in maintaining the syn-conformation of the cofactor. C-4 of the cofactor nicotinamide ring and C-7 of the substrate are highlighted by black spheres, which are 3 ˚A apart, indicating that the substrate is exactly positioned for direct hydride transfer. (d) Cross-section through the active site pocket, showing how tightly the cofactor (pink) and substrate (green) are bound. For clarity, only the nicotinamide ribosyl moiety of the cofactor is shown in panel d, and only the angucyclinone moiety of the substrate is shown in panels c and d (PDB accession number: 5L4L).
