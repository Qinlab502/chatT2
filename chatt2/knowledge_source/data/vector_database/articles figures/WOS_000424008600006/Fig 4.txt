Figure 3. (a) Structure of E. coli DNA GyrA homodimer (55 kDa N-terminal fragment) with two molecules of SD8 bound; one subunit is colored blue and the other in yellow; the SD8 molecules are shown in two shades of green (PDB accession number 4CKL). A DNA duplex taken from a superposed structure of a Staphylococcus aureus gyrase-DNA-drug complex (PDB accession number: 2XCS) is also shown in pink to illustrate that SD8 would block the interaction of G-segment DNA with the DNA-binding ‘saddle’. (b) Top view of panel a, looking down the dimer 2-fold axis. (c) Enlarged view of the boxed region shown in panel b, with the SD8 ligands in stick representation with atom coloration (carbon, green; oxygen, red; nitrogen, blue, chlorine, gray). This clearly shows that the antibiotic spans the dimer interface with distinct binding pockets for the terminal angucyclinone (ANG) and aminocoumarin (AC) groups. (This figure and the other structural figures were prepared using CC4MG; McNicholas et al. 2011.)
