Figure 10. Schematic representation of the hydrophobic substrate-binding pocket of SimC7 showing all residues within 4 ˚A of the ligand, as revealed in the crystal structure of the SimC7 ternary complex with NADP+ and 7-oxo-SD8 (PDB accession number 5L4L). Hydrogen bonds are indicated by dotted lines and van der Waal contacts are indicated by orange arcs. Note that the substrate is bound by only one direct hydrogen bond, connecting the C-7 carbonyl of the angucy- clinone and the side-chain hydroxyl of Ser95. This hydrogen bond may assist in positioning the substrate and facilitate the reaction. However, this interaction is not required for enzymatic activity, since a constructed S95A variant of SimC7 shows near wild-type enzymatic activity (Sch ¨afer et al. 2016). Note that one face of the pocket is formed by the NADP+ cofactor itself. In the natural SimC7 sub- strate, R = H; in the substrate used here, R includes the deoxysugar, tetraene linker and the aminocoumarin. For clarity, all hydrogens have been omitted.
