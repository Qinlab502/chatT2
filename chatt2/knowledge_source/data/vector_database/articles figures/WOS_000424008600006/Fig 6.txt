Figure 7. Structures of (a) SimR-SD8 and (b) SimR-DNA together with schematic representations illustrating the rigid-body rotation of the subunits relative to one another. To emphasize the subunit rotation, the position of the blue subunit is fixed in each panel so that the rotation of the yellow subunit accounts for all the movement in the dimer. The asterisk indicates the pivot point around which rotation occurs. Note that the net effect of subunit rotation is that the distance separating the two recognition helices increases to 41.7 ˚A in the SD8-bound form, a distance incompatible with DNA binding. Note also that helices α9–α10 form a wrapping arm that engages the LBD of the opposing subunit and that these helices additionally form the angucyclinone end of the ligand-binding pocket. (PDB accession numbers: SimR-SD8: 2Y30; SimR-DNA: 3ZQL).
