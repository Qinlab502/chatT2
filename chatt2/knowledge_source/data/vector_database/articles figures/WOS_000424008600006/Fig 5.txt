Figure 5. Comparison of the SimR-SD8 (a,b,c) and SimR-DNA (d,e,f) structures with one SimR subunit shown in blue and the other shown in yellow. The two recognition helices are highlighted in magenta and bound SD8 molecules are shown in green. Note that the ligand-binding pocket in SimR spans the two protein subunits, with the angucyclinone (ANG) end of SD8 bound in one subunit while the aminocoumarin (AC) end is bound in the other such that SD8 skewers the two subunits. Note also that in the apo form of SimR (structure not shown), Arg122 is buried in its cognate subunit; however, in the SimR-SD8 complex, each copy of this residue (shown as red sticks) projects across the dimer interface into a pocket in the surface of the opposing subunit. Arg122 is not ordered in the SimR-DNA structure. (PDB accession numbers: SimR-SD8: 2Y30; SimR-DNA: 3ZQL; SimR-apo: 2Y2Z).
