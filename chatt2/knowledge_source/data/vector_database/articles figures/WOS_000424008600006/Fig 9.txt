Figure 11. Comparison of the canonical SDR ketoreduction mechanism with the novel SimC7 reaction mechanism. (a) In classical SDR proteins, the conserved active site tyrosine serves as a central acid-base catalyst that donates a proton to the substrate. The adjacent lysine residue lowers the pKa of the tyrosine hydroxyl group and often contributes directly to the proton relay mechanism; the hydroxyl group of the serine stabilizes and polarizes the carbonyl group of the substrate. (b) SimC7 has an atypical catalytic triad consisting of Ser95, Ile108 and His112. In the first step of the SimC7 mechanism, the C-7 carbonyl group of the angucyclinone is reduced by transfer of the 4-pro-S hydride of the cofactor onto the C-7 carbon of the substrate. This transfer from below the C-ring results in the characteristic 7-S-stereochemistry of SD8. Ketoreduction at position C-7 is completed by intramolecular proton transfer from the neighboring C-8 hydroxyl group of the angucyclinone; the resultant negative charge on C-8 is stabilized by the adjacent aromatic ring system. In the second step, the C-8 phenolate intermediate regains a proton from bulk water after leaving the substrate binding pocket. In the natural SimC7 substrate, R = H; in the substrate used here, R includes the deoxysugar, tetraene linker and the aminocoumarin. Note that there are no water molecules in the active site pocket that could contribute to the reaction mechanism. In the ternary complex, the nearest water to O-7 of the angucyclinone is ∼5.5 ˚A away, and the nearest water to O-8 is ∼4.9 ˚A away. Because of steric constraints within the pocket, neither could approach the substrate oxygen atoms without either a repositioning of the substrate or a conformational change in the protein.
