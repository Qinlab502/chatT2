Figure 3. (A) Comparison of mdk gene cluster (maduralactomycins) and kin gene cluster (kinamycin). (B) GNPS-based molecular network centered on compound 1 (yellow label). Nodes (circles) represent chemical features. Internal node labels display the precursor mass of compounds (m/z [M + H+]). Line widths of edges mirror cosine distances. (C) Biosynthetic proposal for the formation of compounds 1 and 3 based on gene cluster homologies, GNPS molecular networking analysis, and 13C-labeling studies. (Atoms are numbered according to biosynthetic origin.)
