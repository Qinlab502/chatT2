Figure 2. Planar structures of maduralactomycin A (1) showing (A) HMBC correlations and (B) the 13C acetate labeling pattern. (C) Crystal structure of actinospirol A (3) shown as an ORTEP plot with displacement ellipsoids of non-hydrogen atoms drawn at 50% probability level and (D) molecular structure and atom labeling of actinospirol A (3) showing the 13C-acetate labeling pattern.
