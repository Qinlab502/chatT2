Fig. 4. Biochemical and structural characterizations of KstA11-catalyzed re- duction-dearomatization. (A) HPLC analysis (UV at 254 nm) of enzymatic reaction with NADH. (B) The combined ribbon representation and stick model showing the overall structure of KstA11 in complex with cofactor NAD+ and substrate. The bound cofactor NAD+ and substrate are shown in the stick model. (C) The combined surface charge potential representation (contoured at Â±4 kT/eV; blue/ + red) and the stick model showing the detailed interactions of KstA11 with NAD and substrate. (D) Stereo view showing the detailed interactions among key + residues of KstA11, NAD , and substrate. The hydrogen bonds involved in the binding are shown as dotted gray lines. (E) UV/Vis analysis of the reaction. (F) Proposed chemical reaction. (G) Proposed reaction mechanism from 5a to 6a.
