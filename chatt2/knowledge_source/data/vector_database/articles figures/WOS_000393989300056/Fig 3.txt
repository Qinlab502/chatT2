Fig. 5. Biochemical assay of KstA10-catalyzed dehydration-rearomatization. (A) Chemical reactions. HPLC analysis (UV at 254 nm) of enzymatic reactions using 6b as the substrate by KstA10 (B) and 5 as the substrate by KstA11/ KstA10 (C). (D) Proposed reaction mechanism. Comparison of the 1H-NMR (I) and 13C-NMR (II) spectra of 2H-6b with 6b (E) and 2H-4 with 4 (F).
