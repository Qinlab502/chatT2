Figure 1. Comparison of 1H NMR spectra. 1H NMR (600 MHz, in CD3OD) was obtained on the crude extracts from wild-type strain Streptomyces sp. MBT76 (bottom) and its ex-conjugant MBT76-1 (top). The presented chemical shifts are for aromatic region δ 5.4−8.1 and aliphatic region δ 1.2−4.5. The signals attributable to compounds produced in MBT76 wild type were indicated as the following: a, acetyltryptamine; b, 2-hydroxy-3- methoxy-benzamide; p, 1H-pyrrole-2-carboxamide; f, fervenulin; mc, methoxylated isocoumarins. The signals attributable to compounds produced in MBT76-1 were labeled according to the numbering in Figure 2, and the detailed signals assignments were summarized in Table S1. The highlighted signals by red arrows are attributable to glycosylated pyranonaphthoquinone molecules.
