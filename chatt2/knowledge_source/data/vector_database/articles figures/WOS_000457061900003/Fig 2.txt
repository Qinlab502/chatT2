Figure 3. (A) Biosynthetic origin of lysoquinone-TH1 (7) and the proposed structure of lysoquinone- TH2 (8): Biosynthesis hypothesis from feeding experiments with doubly labeled [1,2-13C2] acetate with the S. albus host strain and heterologous expression of the lysolipin minimal PKS genes (llpD-F) and cyclase genes (llpCI-CIII). (B) Oxytetracycline (6) from a biosynthesis primed with malonamide in the wild-type producer, and with two acetate units in the mutant producer.
