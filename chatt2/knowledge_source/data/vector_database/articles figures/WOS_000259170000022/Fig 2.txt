Fig. 4. Negative ion ESI mass spectra of saturating mixtures of anthracyclines with Rt1 DNA. (A) Rt1 alone; (B) Rt1:Dn, 1:11; (C) Rt1:Dx, 1:13; (D) Rt1:CosD, 1:4. (s) ss- or dsDNA alone; (h) Rt1 + 2 anthracyclines; (D) Rt1 + 3 anthracyclines; (d) Rt1 + 4 anthracyclines; (N) Rt1 + 5 anthracyclines; (j) Rt1 + 6 anthracyclines; ( ) Rt1 + 7 anthracyclines. (E) The intensities of ion from each complex in a spectrum were summed and expressed as a percentage of the sum of the intensities of all ions in the spectrum to give binding proÔ¨Åles of each anthracycline to Rt1. ( ) Rt1:Dn, 1:11; ( ) Rt1:CosD, 1:4.
