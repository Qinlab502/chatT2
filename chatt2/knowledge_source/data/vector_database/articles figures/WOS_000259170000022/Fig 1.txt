Fig. 3. Agarose gel electrophoresis of anthracycline-pUC9 complexes. (A) Dn-pUC9, (B) Dx-pUC9, (C) CosD-pUC9. In each gel lanes 1 and 15 contain plasmid only; lanes 2 and 16 contain pUC9 linearised by treatment with HindIII. No samples were loaded in lanes 3 and 14. The drug-to-nucleotide ratios, rb, for gels A and C, lanes 4– 13, were 0.0027, 0.0081, 0.0136, 0.0190, 0.0244, 0.0298, 0.0353, 0.0407, 0.0461 and 0.0515, respectively. For gel B, the ratios for lanes 4–13 were 0.0130, 0.0261, 0.0391, 0.0522, 0.0652, 0.0782, 0.0913, 0.1043, 0.1173 and 0.1304, respectively. The bands corresponding to supercoiled closed circular DNA (sc) and open circles (oc) are marked by arrows.
