Fig. 4. Physical characterization of recombinant AraGT. (A) Native PAGE. Puriﬁed AraGT at the indicated amounts was analyzed by 8% native PAGE (lanes 3 and 4) and stained with Coomassie Bril- lant Blue. Lane 1 catalase (240 kDa), lane 2 bovine serum albumin (68 kDa). (B) Thermal stability of AraGT monitored by ﬂuorescence. Changes in the intrinsic ﬂuorescence of puriﬁed AraGT (50 (cid:1)g) were followed as a function of temperature as described (Vrontou et al., 2004).
