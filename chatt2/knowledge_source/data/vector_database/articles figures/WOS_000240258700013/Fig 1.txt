Fig. 2. Heterologous expression and solubility of AraGT in E. coli. (A) Induced and non-induced cell samples from AraGT expression in E. coli strains BL21(DE3)pLysS and JM109(DE3)pLysS were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and either stained with Coomassie Brillant Blue or immunostained with anti-hexahistidinyl antibody as indicated. (B) Solubility of AraGT. The soluble and insoluble fractions from expressed AraGT in JM109(DE3)pLysS were analyzed as in (A). Lane 1, molecular weight markers: (cid:2)-galactosidase (116 kDa), bovine serum albumin (68 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (35 kDa), restriction endonuclease Bsp98I (25 kDa).
