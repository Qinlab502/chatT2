Figure 4. HPLC proﬁles of extracts from S. coelicolor CH999 harboring the plasmids pRM5 (A) and pETR512 (B), respectively. The elution was performed as described in materials and methods using an acetonitrile:H2 O gradient from 20–80% (containing 1% acetic acid) in 45 min. The absorbance at 280 nm was detected.
