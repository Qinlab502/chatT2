Figure 2. Multiple sequence alignment of the deduced peptide sequences of NcnH, ActVA-5 (Caballero et al. 1991) and Gra-ORF21 (Ichinose et al. 1998). Numbers indicate the positions of the amino acids within the sequence. Highly conserved aa (identical in at least two proteins) are shown in white letters with black background.
