Figure 1. Preliminary physical map of the 33 kb chromosomal region representing the naphthocyclinone cluster from Streptomyces arenae (cid:3) DSM40737. The 3.5 kb BamHI fragment hybridizing to the schC probe (0.55 kb PCR fragment generated with the primers 5 GCAGGG- (cid:3) GATCCGCCGGGCCG 3 with pUO6030 as the template) is enlarged and the identiÔ¨Åed open reading frames and the putative terminator region (ter) are indicated.
