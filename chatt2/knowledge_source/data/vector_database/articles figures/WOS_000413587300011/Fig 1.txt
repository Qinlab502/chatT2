Fig. 2. Circular genome map of S. albolongus YIM 101047. The circular map consists of six circles. From the outermost circle inwards, circle (1) shows ncRNA distribution in the forward strand, including tRNA, rRNA, and sRNA; circle (2) shows the distribution of genes related to COG categories in the forward strand; circle (3) shows the distribution of genes related to COG categories in the backward strand; circle (4) shows ncRNA distribution in the backward strand, including tRNA, rRNA, and sRNA; and circle (5) and circle (6) show GC content and GC skew, respectively.
