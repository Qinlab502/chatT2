Figure 2. Phylogenetic relationships of the angucycline monooxyge- nases investigated in this study with the much studied p- hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (pHBH, Protein Data Bank entry 1PDH) shown as an out-group. The tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method as described previously,20 and bootstrap values for the clades are displayed. The scale bar represents 10% dissimilarity.
