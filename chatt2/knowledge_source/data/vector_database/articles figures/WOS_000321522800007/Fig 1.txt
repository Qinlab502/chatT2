Figure 1. Crystal structure of native PgaE and the P78Q/I79F variant described in this study. (A) Overall structure of PgaE with prejadomycin docked into the active site and regions of interest highlighted. The protein has been color-coded on the basis of its similarity with JadH in the following manner: black for dissimilar amino acid residues, gray for similar residues, white for identical residues, and orange for the region of interest. (B) Comparison of native (orange) and P78Q/I79F (yellow) variant structures of PgaE around the β4−β5 hairpin. (C) Dimer structure of the PgaE P78Q/I79F variant with the mutated residues highlighted as red space-ﬁlling models.
