Figure 4. Model explaining the function of PgaE and the eﬀects caused by mutagenesis of the β4−β5 region. The two monomers of the PgaE dimer are colored white and gray, while the two overlapping binding sites for C-12 and C-12b hydroxylation are depicted as 1 in a circle and 2 in a diamond, respectively. Allosteric interactions are represented by the shape of the line between the two monomers. (A) In C-12 hydroxylation, the substrate prejadomycin (black circle) may bind to the sites for C-12 and C-12b hydroxylations leading to catalysis and substrate inhibition, respectively. Binding of the ﬁrst molecule of prejadomycin induces an allosteric eﬀect, which lowers the enzymatic activity of the bisubstrate complex. (B) In C-12b hydroxylation after depletion of prejadomycin, the substrate (gray diamond) may bind only to the orientation for the second C-12b hydroxylation and the enzymatic activity is mainly derived from the bisubstrate complex. (C) The allosteric substrate inhibition in C-12 hydroxylation is conveyed via H73, P78, and I79 across the dimer interface to the other subunit.
