Figure 3. Spectrophotometric comparison of the two activities of chimeric PgaE enzymes using prejadomycin as a substrate. The consumption of the initial substrate prejadomycin can be followed as a decrease in the magnitude of the signal at 406 nm (···). The production and subsequent consumption of 12-hydroxyprejadomycin can be monitored as an increase and a decrease in absorbance at 510 nm (), respectively.13,18 The two reactions occur in separate phases18 that are indicated by background color: (A) native PgaE, (B) the β4−β5 single chimera, (C) the β4−β5/β6 double chimera, (D) the β4−β5/β15−β16 double chimera, (E) the β4−β5/β14 double chimera, (F) the β4−β5/β6/β14 triple chimera, (G) the β4−β5/β14/β15−β16 triple chimera, (H) the β4−β5/β6/β15−β16 triple chimera, and (I) the β4−β5/β6/β14/β15−β16 quadruple chimera.
