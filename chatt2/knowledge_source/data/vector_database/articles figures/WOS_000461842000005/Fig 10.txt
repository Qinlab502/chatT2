Fig. 10 Formation of a cyclic ether by the pyran synthase (PS) domain of trans-AT PKS. The pyran and furan rings that are constructed by the PS domain are shown in blue and red. (A) Formation of a tetrahy- dropyran ring catalyzed by PedPS in pederin biosynthesis. (B) Forma- tion of a dihydropyran ring catalyzed by SorPS8 in sorangicin A biosynthesis. (C) Formation of a tetrahydrofuran ring catalyzed by OocPS in oocydin A biosynthesis. (D) Formation of a tetrahydropyran ring catalyzed by TstPS7 in thailanstatin A biosynthesis.
