Fig. 4 Dialkylresorcinol and stilbene formation by DarA- and DarB-type enzymes. The newly formed bond due to a Michael-type addition is shown in red. X indicates CoA or CP. (A) Dialkylresorcinol synthesis by DarA and DarB. The butenoyl moiety is shown in blue. (B) Isopropylstilbene synthesis by StlC and StlD. The 5-phenyl-2,4-pentadienoyl moiety is shown in blue. (C) Lumiquinone A biosynthesis.
