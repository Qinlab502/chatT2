Fig. 3 Rhizoxin branching module structure. (A) Overall structure of the dimeric rhizoxin branching module (PDB: 4KC5). The KS domain, the KSâ€“B linker domain, and B domain are shown in green, yellow, and magenta, respectively. (B) Comparison of the active site structures of the rhizoxin branching KS domain (PDB: 4KC5; green) and the 6- deoxyerythronolide B synthase KS (PDB: 2HG4; cyan). The catalytic triad residues are shown as sticks.
