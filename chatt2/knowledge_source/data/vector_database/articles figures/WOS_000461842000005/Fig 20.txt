Fig. 21 Biosynthesis of cylindrospermopsin and guadinomine B. (A) Reactions of the ﬁrst three modules of cylindrospermopsin PKS. The guanidinoacetate unit is shown in blue. The newly formed bond due to a Michael-type addition is shown in red. (B) Reactions of the ﬁrst three modules of guadinomine PKS. Abbreviation: A: adenylation domain.
