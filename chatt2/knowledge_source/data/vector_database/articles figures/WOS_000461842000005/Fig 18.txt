Fig. 19 Reaction of a CmiS1-type enzyme. (A) Structures of cremimycin and related macrolactam polyketides. The nitrogen atom introduced by a CmiS1-type enzyme is shown in blue. (B) Formation of 3-aminononanoic acid in cremimycin biosynthesis. The newly formed bond due to a Michael-type addition is shown in red. (C) Formation of 3-isocyanobutyric acid in the biosynthesis of isonitrile-containing peptides.
