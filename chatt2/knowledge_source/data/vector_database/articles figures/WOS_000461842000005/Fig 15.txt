Fig. 15 Tetrahydropyran ring formation in salinomycin biosynthesis. (A) Structures of salinomycin and indanomycin. The pyran rings that are formed by a SalBIII-type enzyme are shown in blue and red. The cyclic ethers (Bâ€“E rings) of salinomycin that are not formed by SalBIII are shown in green. (B) Reaction mechanism of SalBIII.
