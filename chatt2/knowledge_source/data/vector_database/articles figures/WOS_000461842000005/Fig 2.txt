Fig. 2 Branching module reaction. (A) Branching module reaction in rhizoxin biosynthesis. The d-lactone moiety is shown in blue. The newly formed bond due to a Michael-type addition is shown in red. (B) Branching module reaction in the biosynthesis of glutarimide-containing polyketides. The glutarimide moiety is shown in blue. Abbreviations: B: branching domain; CP: carrier protein; KS: ketosynthase; X: unknown domain.
