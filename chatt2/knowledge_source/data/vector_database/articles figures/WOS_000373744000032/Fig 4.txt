Fig. 3 Construction of the Î”hex30 mutant strain CIM-H001 and comparative HPLC analyses of CIM-H001 and Streptosporangium sp. CGMCC 4.7309. a Diagram illustrating the construction of CIM-H001 by replacing hex30 with an apramycin-resistant gene cassette (aac(3)IV). b Confirmation of the genotype of CIM-H001 by PCR. Lane 1 DNA ladder; lane 2 fragment obtained by PCR using the wild-type strain Streptosporangium sp. CGMCC 4.7309 as a template; lane 3 fragment obtained by PCR using CIM-H001 as a temple. c HPLC traces of Streptosporangium sp. CGMCC 4.7309 and CIM-H001. Hexaricin A (1), hexaricin B (2) and hexaricin C (3) were marked in bold. The UV absorption spectrum of hexaricin A (1) was shown on the top right corner
