Figure 5. Results of the Docking Studies Angucyclinones (A) 3 and (B) 5 docked into the active-site cavities of UrdMred and LanV, respec- tively. Catalytic amino acids are shown in magenta, ligands 3 and 5 in cyan and NADP+ in yellow. The green dashed lines represent the hydrogen- bonding Tyr160, ligand, and NADP+. The coordi- nated water molecule in the active site of LanV was essential for the formation of the 6R stereochem- istry of 5. See also Figure S5.
