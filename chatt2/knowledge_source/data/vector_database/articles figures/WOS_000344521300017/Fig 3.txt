Figure 3. Structure-Based Multiple-Sequence Alignment of Angucycline 6-Ketoreductases LanV, CabV, PgaMred, and UrdMred The sequence motifs for NADPH binding and catalysis are highlighted in pink. The regions (R1 to R4) investigated in this study are marked in orange. The star indicates residues important for stereochemical control of related ketoreductases involved in natural-product biosynthesis. See also Table S1.
