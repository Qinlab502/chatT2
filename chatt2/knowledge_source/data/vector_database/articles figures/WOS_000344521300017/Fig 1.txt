Figure 1. Structures of Selected Angucycline Metabolites and Their Biosynthesis (A) Structures of the glycosylated metabolites landomycin D (1) and urdamycin M (2), and the angucyclinones gaudimycin C (3) and rabelomycin (8). (B) Model for the angucyclinone redox modiÔ¨Åcation reactions on the landomycin and urdamycins/gaudimycin pathways. See also Figure S4 and Table S2.
