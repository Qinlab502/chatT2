Figure 2. Stereoview Images of UrdMred and LanV (A) The overall structure of UrdMred in complex with NADP+ and 8. (B) Surface view of UrdMred with calculated electrostatics demonstrating the hydrophobic binding site of the ligand. The surface is colored according to the electrostatic potential at 23(cid:2)C ((cid:3)22â€“22 kT/e) with positive potential colored blue and negative potential colored red.
