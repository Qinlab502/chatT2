Figure 5. (a–d) represent the PCA models for the nodes mw, yq, ss, and bm from Figure S2, respectively. Sub-plots (i–iv) correspond to (a–d), respectively, highlighting the position of A1901 using a red dot while de-emphasizing other points in the plot by making them grey. Without the utilization of hcapca, the discovery of the new anticancer compounds would not have been possible.
