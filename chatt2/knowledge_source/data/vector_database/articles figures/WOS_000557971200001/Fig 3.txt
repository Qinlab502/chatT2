Figure 3. Scheme depicting hcapca logic. Note also that a small (35 sample) example of the walk through of hcapca processing and interactive visualization is depicted in Supplementary Information Figures S4–S13. (a) The ﬁrst tree is partitioned into two smaller sub-clusters. (b) Since the SoV12 for the two sub-clusters does not meet the cutoﬀ value (25%), they are further split into smaller groups (c). The SoV12 of the red and green clusters is more than the cutoﬀ value and so their partitioning stops and PCA models are made (red/green squares). The green and blue sub-clusters have SoV12s lower than
