Figure 2. (a) Partial dendrogram generated from an HCA of all 1046 samples. The scale on the left denotes dissimilarity i.e., the closer to the bottom a pair of samples are, the more similar they are to each other. Only a small subset of the ﬁgure is shown for clarity; the original complete dendrogram may be found in the Supplementary Information as Figures S1 (linear display) and S3 (circular display). (b) Arbitrary dissimilarity cutoﬀ choice of 0.95 results in eight diﬀerent groups being formed. The groups have been colored accordingly. The eight groups have been colored as red, brown, grey, blue, magenta, teal, orange, and green. The yellow dots indicate the point at which the tree branch diverges to form each respective colored group of samples.
