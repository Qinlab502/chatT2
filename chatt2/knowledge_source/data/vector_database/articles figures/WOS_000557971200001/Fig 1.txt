Figure 1. Subplots (aâ€“d) show the PCA scores plot for four datasets. The number of samples in each dataset is shown in the top right corner of each plot. The total variance explained by a principal component (PC) is shown in parentheses next to the axis labels on each subplot. As the number of samples in a PCA decreases, the variance explained by each PC increases due to a combination of fewer samples and lesser overall variance in the dataset.
