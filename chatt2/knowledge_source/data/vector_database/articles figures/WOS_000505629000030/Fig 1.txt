Figure 3. (A) HCT116 cells were treated with 2 μM 3 and 1 μM 5 or DMSO (negative control) for 6 h followed by Western blot analysis for the indicated proteins. (B) Impact of 1 μM 8 on axolotl embryo tail regeneration at 7 dpa compared to vehicle control (DMSO). Note that control embryos but not embryos treated with 8 regenerated a rounded tail tip typical of the unamputated condition.
