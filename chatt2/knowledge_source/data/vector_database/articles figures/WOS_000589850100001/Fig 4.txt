Figure 5. MD simulation of Mpro-Co-crystalized ligand. A) Backbone RMSD of the co-crystalized Mpro-ligand; B; The RMSF plot of the docked complex. The fluctua- tions indicate the flexibility in the docked complex; C) The Ligand Root Mean Square Fluctuation (L-RMSF). Useful for characterizing changes in the ligand atom positions; D) Mpro-co-crystalized ligand contacts; E) Timeline representation of the interactions and contacts (H-bonds, Hydrophobic, and water bridges).
