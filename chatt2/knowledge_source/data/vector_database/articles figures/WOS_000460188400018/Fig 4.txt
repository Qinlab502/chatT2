Fig. 4. Large open tunnel in AlpK A) The tunnel exists between the middle domain (cyan) and the FAD-binding domain (yellow). The left panel shows the tunnel on surface of AlpK. The right panel shows the proﬁle of the tunnel after a 180(cid:3) rotation. B) & C) show the proﬁles of pocket-7.7 and pocket-8.7, respectively. D) & E) show the interaction between the substrate residues in pocket-7.7 and pocket-8.7, respectively. This ﬁgure is drawn using Ligplotþ [15].
