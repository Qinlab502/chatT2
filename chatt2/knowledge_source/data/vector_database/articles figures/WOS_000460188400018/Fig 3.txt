Fig. 2. AlpK forms dimer both in solution and crystal structure A) The AlpK dimer in crystal is mediated through helices a7, a8, and a9. B) AlpK forms dimer in solution analyzed by gel Ô¨Åltration chromatography. The blue and red curve shows UV absorption of AlpK at 280 nm and 260 nm, respectively. Protein mass weight markers at different elution volumes are shown. C) The AlpK dimer is mediated through electrostatic interaction among Glu359, Arg369 and Arg332. D) The alignment of AlpK with PagE, CabE and BexE suggests that Arg332, Glu359 and Arg369 is highly conserved in the pHBH family.
