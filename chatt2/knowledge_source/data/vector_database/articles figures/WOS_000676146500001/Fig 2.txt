Figure 2. Analyses of the extracts of S. sp. TÜ17 wild type and recombinant strains. (A) Bioassay analysis of S. sp. TÜ17 and the recombinant strains S. sp. TÜ17::pEM1, S. sp. TÜ17::pEM2. Indicator strain Bacillus subtilis; 10 µL of the extracts were spotted of each culture on ﬁlter disc (1 mL ethylacetate extract was evaporated and dissolved in 100 µL methanol). Inhibition zone of S. sp. TÜ17::pEM1 ø 1.2 cm. (B) HPLC/MS analysis of S. sp. TÜ17 and the recombinant strains S. sp. TÜ17::pEM1, S. sp. TÜ17::pEM2. A peak with m/z 464.1703 [M+H]+, corresponding to mayamycin, was only detected in the extract of S. sp. TÜ17::pEM1. (C) HPLC/MS analysis of S. sp. TÜ17 and the recombinant strain S. sp. TÜ17::pEM-aur1P, S. sp. TÜ17::pEM-pntR, S. sp. TÜ17::pEM-strR, S. sp. TÜ17::pEM-fkbN, S. sp. TÜ17. The peak with m/z 464.1703 [M+H]+, corresponding to mayamycin, was only detected in the extract of S. sp. TÜ17::pEM-aur1P.
