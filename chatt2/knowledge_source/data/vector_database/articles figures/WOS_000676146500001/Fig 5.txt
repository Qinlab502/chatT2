Figure 5. HPLC/MS analysis of the extracts of S. sp. TÜ10 wild type and recombinant strains. Extracts (1 mL ethylacetate extract was evaporated and dissolved in 100 µL methanol) of S. sp. TÜ10::pEMaur1P, S. sp. TÜ10::pEMpntR and S. sp. TÜ10::pEMaur1PpntR, S. sp. TÜ10::pEM1, S. sp. TÜ10::pEM2, S. sp. TÜ10 were analysed via HPLC/MS. A peak with m/z 1048.4 [M+H]+, correspond- ing to warkmycin and a peak with m/z 1006.4 [M+H]+ corresponding to deacetyl-warkmycin, were only detected in the recombinant strains S. sp. TÜ10::pEM1 and S. sp. TÜ10::pEMaur1PpntR.
