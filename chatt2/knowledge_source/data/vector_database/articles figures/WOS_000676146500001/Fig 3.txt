Figure 3. Analyses of the extracts of S. sp. TÜ102 wild type and recombinant strains. (A) Bioassay analysis of S. sp. TÜ102 and the recombinant strains S. sp. TÜ102::pEM1, S. sp. TÜ102::pEM2 and S. sp. TÜ102. Indicator strain Bacillus subtilis; 10 µL of the extracts were spotted of each culture on ﬁlter disc (1 mL ethylacetate extract was evaporated and dissolved in 100 µL methanol). Inhibition zone of S. sp. TÜ102::pEM2 ø 1 cm. (B) HPLC/MS analysis of S. sp. TÜ102 and the recombinant strains S. sp. TÜ102::pEM1, S. sp. TÜ102::pEM2, S. sp. TÜ102 and S. sp. TÜ102 pRM4_actIIORF4-aur1PR3. A peak with m/z 1302.4 [M+H]+, corresponding to chartreusin, was only detected in the recombinant strains S. sp. TÜ102::pEM2 and S. sp. TÜ102 pRM4_actIIORF4-aur1PR3.
