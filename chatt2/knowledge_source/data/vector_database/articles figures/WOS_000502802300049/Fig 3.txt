Fig. 5. Experimental characterization of bgc3. (A) The DNA sequence of bgc3, discovered from human oral  metagenomic data, was codon optimized for Streptomyces sp., synthesized, assembled, and cloned into the  heterologous host S. albus. Terminator (black dots) and constitutive promoter (black arrows) sequences were  engineered to control the expression of bgc3 in S. albus (see supplementary materials). (B) HPLC-MS analysis  of a chemical extract from the culture of S. albus::bgc3 (red) in comparison to one from S. albus with an empty  vector  control  (blue).  An  HPLC  chromatogram  at  the  absorbance  of  400  nm  is  shown  for  both  samples,  indicating four bgc3-specific peaks produced by S. albus::bgc3 and not the control (1 to 4, highlighted in yellow).  (C) Molecular structure of metamycins A-D (1 to 4), the products of bgc3. The asterisks indicate the relative  configuration at the chiral carbons.
