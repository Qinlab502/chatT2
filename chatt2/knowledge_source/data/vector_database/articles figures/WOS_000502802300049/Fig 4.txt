Fig. 6. Experimental characterization of bgc6. (A) The DNA sequence of bgc6 was cloned from the gut isolate  B. wexlerae DSM 19850 into the heterologous host  B. subtilis-168-sfp. The black arrow indicates a constitutive  promoter  that  was  engineered  to  control  the  expression  of  bgc6  in  B.  subtilis-168-sfp  (see  supplementary  materials).  (B)  HPLC-MS  analysis  of  a  chemical  extract  from  the  culture  of  B.  subtilis-168-sfp::bgc6  (red)  in  comparison to one from B. subtilis-168-sfp with an empty vector control (blue). An HPLC chromatogram at the  absorbance of 400 nm is shown for both samples, indicating a single bgc6-specific peak produced by B. subtilis- 168-sfp::bgc6 and not the control (5, highlighted in yellow). (C) Molecular structures of wexrubicin (5), the product  of  bgc6,  and  the  related  anticancer  drug,  doxorubicin.  (D)  A  heat  map  indicating  the  antimicrobial  activity  of  metamycins A-D (1 to 4), and wexrubicin (5), against a panel of representative oral, skin, and gut isolates of the  human  microbiome.  The  activity  is  measured  in  micromolar  as  the  minimum  inhibitory  concentration  on  agar  (MIC-A). The antibiotic tetracycline (T) was tested in the same manner, and its activity is compared to that of the  newly discovered polyketides. Note that only metamycin C (3) and metamycin D (4) exert antimicrobial activities  against several isolates, with metamycin D activity being similar to that of tetracycline in several cases.
