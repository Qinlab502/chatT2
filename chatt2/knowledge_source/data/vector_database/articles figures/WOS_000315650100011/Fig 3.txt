Fig. 2 a High-resolution S1 nuclease mapping of the TSP for the aur1Ap promoter in S. aureofaciens CCM3239 wild-type strain. The 5′-labelled DNA fragment was hybridised with 40 μg RNA and treated with 120 U of S1 nuclease. RNA was isolated from the cultures grown in liquid Bennet medium to the time points indicated. E. coli tRNA was used as a control (lane C). c Control S1 nuclease mapping experiments with the same RNA samples and a DNA probe for the hrdBp2 pro- moter (Kormanec and Farkasovsky 1993). The RNA-protected DNA fragments were analysed on DNA sequencing gels together with G+A (lane A) and T+C (lane T) sequencing ladders derived from the end- labelled fragments (Maxam and Gilbert 1980). All S1 nuclease map- ping experiments were performed two times with independent sets of RNA with similar results
