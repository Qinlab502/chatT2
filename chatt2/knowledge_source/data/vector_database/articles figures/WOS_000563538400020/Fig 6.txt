Figure 6.   Phylogenetic tree based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences, obtained by Neighbor–Joining method  analysis for the bioactive strains CMAA 1527 and CMAA 1653 and their closely related type strains—MEGA  7.042. Numbers at nodes indicate the level of bootstrap support based on 1,000 replications (only values > 50%  are shown). Streptacidiphilus oryzae was used as outgroup for this study.
