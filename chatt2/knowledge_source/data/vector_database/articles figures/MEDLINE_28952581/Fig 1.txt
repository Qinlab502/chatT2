Figure 1. Effect of different inﬂuencing parameters in granaticinic acid production (antimicrobial activity) by one-variable-at-a-time (OVAT) study; (a) inﬂuence of media on activity; (b) growth antimicrobial production; (c) inﬂuence of inoculum concentration; (d) inﬂuence of curve vs. initial media pH; (e) inﬂuence of incubation temperature; (f) inﬂuence of glucose concentration on antimicrobial production.
