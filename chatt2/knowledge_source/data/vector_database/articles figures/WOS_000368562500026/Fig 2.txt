Figure 3. Simocyclinone biosynthetic gene clusters from S. antibioticus Tü6040 (sim), K. sp. (smc), and S. sp. NRRL B-24484 (sml). In yellow are labeled genes involved in aminocoumarin biosynthesis; blue, genes involved in deoxysugar formation; green, genes responsible for the angucyclic core synthesis; pink, genes putatively involved in modiﬁcation of the polyketide chain precursor; red, type I polyketide synthase genes; dark gray, regulatory genes; dark blue, eﬄux; pale gray, genes of unknown function; white, genes previously annotated as ﬂanking in the sim cluster. Blue arrows indicate operons.
