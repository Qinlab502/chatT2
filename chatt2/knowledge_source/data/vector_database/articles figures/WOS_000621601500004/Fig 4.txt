Figure 4. (A) Schematics of gene cassettes contained in pXZ6 and pXZ11. Restriction sites used for cloning are designated; (B) Metabolic proﬁle of M1152::pXZ6 grown in TSB medium; (C) Metabolic proﬁle of M1152::pXZ11 grown in TSB medium. The metabolic proﬁle of M1152::pXZ4 was used as the negative control in both assays. Peaks for the target compounds are labeled.
