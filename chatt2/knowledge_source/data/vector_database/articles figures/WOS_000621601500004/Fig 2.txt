Figure 2. (A) Schematics of pXZ4, pXZ5′, and pXZ5 operons. Unique cloning sites introduced into the expression vector pXZ4 were shown. Circled J represents the “junction sequence” that resides between PactI and the RBS of actI-orf1 in the actinorhodin cluster contained in S. coelicolor A3(2) genome; (B) anti-His Western blots of protein samples isolated from M1152::pXZ4, M1152::pXZ5′, and M1152::pXZ5. The eGFP-His protein isolated from Streptomyces host24 was used as the positive control (+).
