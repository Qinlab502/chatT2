Figure 5. (A) Schematics of gene cassettes generated to construct pBE, pFkm, pRub, and pTcm. All cassettes have EcoRI and XbaI sites on 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, for cloning (not shown); (B) Metabolic proﬁles of S. coelicolor M1152 transformant strains grown in R4 media; (C) Metabolic proﬁle of M1152::pTcm grown in SM medium. The metabolic proﬁles of M1152::pXZ4 grown in each medium were used as the negative controls in both assays. Peaks for the target compounds are labeled.
