Figure 1. Biosynthetic pathway of bacterial PK-IIs. (A) The general overview of PK-II biosynthesis showing four phases and enzymes involved in each phase. Medermycin belonging to the BIQ subclass was used as the example compound; (B) Combinations of enzymes required for the “immediate tailoring” phase in the biosynthesis of four common PK-II core structures. Gene function abbreviations: C9KR  ketoreductases for C-9 ketoreduction;4 AroCycN1-C  bifunctional (didomain) AroCyc enzymes;14 AroCycN2  monofunctional AroCyc enzymes that are members of the SRPBCC superfamily;14 Cyc1  TcmI-like polyketide cyclases;13 Cyc2  TcmJ-like polyketide cyclases;13 Cyc3  proteins that are members of the NTF-2 superfamily; Cyc5  cyclases that are members of the metallo β-lactamase superfamily; C3KR  ketoreductases for C- 3 ketoreduction;15 MOX1  PdmH-like monooxygenase;13,16 MOX2  PdmI-like monooxygenase;13,16 and pen19KR  ketoreductases for PEN C-19 ketoreduction.13,16 The color codes are showing the reaction sites corresponding to each enzyme.
