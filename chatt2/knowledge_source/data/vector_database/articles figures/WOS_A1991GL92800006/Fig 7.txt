Figure 6 shows the 3-D structure of the central four base pairs plus drug of the 1:1 complex  of steffimycin with a DNA decamer duplex with the sequence of d(CGTACGTACG),  drawn using ORTEP-11 (31 ). This model is constructed based on a number of building  principles  derived  from  the  structures  of other  anthracycline-DNA  complexes  which have been determined by x-ray crystallography and NMR previously (8-15).  First, the elongated aglycone chromophore skewers the DNA molecule such that it  is almost perpendicular to the C 1' -C 1' vectors of the two GC base pairs above and  below the intercalator. The drug spans the two grooves of the helix with the sugar in the  minor groove and the D-ring protruding in the major groove. The A-ring is puckered and  a consequence of this pucker is that the 08 methoxy is in the axial position pointing  perpendicular to the plane of the drug. Its oxygen may be in a position to receive a  hydrogen bond from the N2 amino group of a guanine base.
