Figure 6: Stereoscopic diagram of the detailed surroundings of the intercalated steffimycin in the model  of the decamer-steffimycin complex. Four base pairs (with the sequence ACGT) of the decamer helix are  shown.  Hydrogen bonds between the steffimycin  and DNA are shown  as  dotted lines.  In the  minor  groove, three hydrogen bonds are found. The oxygen 08 of the steffunycin methoxy group receives a hydrogen  bond (2.86 A) from  the N2 amino group of an adjacent guanine residue (G 16).  In addition, N2 of G6  donates a hydrogen bond (2.85 A) to the 07 atom ofS21 sugar and 03' ofS21 sugar to 02 ofT7 (3.10A).  The tight fit of drug to  DNA results in the large buckle of base pairs at the CpG intercalation site.
