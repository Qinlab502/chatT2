Figure 3. FB Binds Prx1 and Grx3 and Potently Inhibits Prx1 Activity (A) Structures of active probe 1 and inactive probe 2. (B) HCT116 cell lysates were incubated with various concentrations of probe 1 or probe 2 in the absence or presence of a 10-fold excess of FB for 1 hr, followed by pull-down with streptavidin-agarose (SA) and western blot analysis for the indicated proteins. (C) The recombinant Prx1 (top) or Grx3 (bottom) was incubated with 1 mM probe 1 or probe 2 for 1 hr, followed by SA pull-down and western blot analysis for the indicated proteins.
