Figure 1. FB Inhibits Cap-Dependent Translation Mediated by 4E-BP1 (A) Inhibition of cap-dependent translation by Streptomyces sp. RM-4-15 bacterial extract. HCT116 CRC cells were transfected with a bicistronic luciferase reporter (upper diagram) for 24 hr, followed by treatment with different concentrations of bacterial extract for 12 hr. Cap-dependent Renilla luciferase activity was normalized with cap-independent ﬁreﬂy luciferase activity. The results are expressed as the inhibition of cap-dependent translation relative to the untreated controls. (B) Structures of FB and UCF76-A. (C) Inhibition of cap-dependent translation by representative pure metabolites (RM1-RM7) of Streptomyces sp. RM-4-15. RM1, UCF76-A; RM2, FB. (D) HCT116 cells were treated with 1 mM MK2206 and 100 nM PD0325901 alone and in combination, 100 nM rapamycin, 0.5 mM AZD8055, 2 mM UCF76-A, 2 mM FB, or DMSO control for 12 hr followed by western blot analysis for the indicated proteins. (E and F) HCT116 cells with stable expression of two different sets of 4E-BP1 shRNAs or control shRNA (ShCtrl) were analyzed by western blot for 4E-BP1 and b-actin (E) or determined for cap-dependent translation activity after treatment with 2 mM FB or DMSO control for 12 hr (F). Data are shown as mean ± SEM (n = 3). *p < 0.001; NS, not signiﬁcant. See also Figure S1.
