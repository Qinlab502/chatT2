Figure 4. FB Directly Targets the Active Cysteine Residues of Prx1 and Grx3 (A–D) HCT116 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged wild-type (WT) Prx1 (A and C) or Grx3 (B and D), their mutants, or control vector for 36 hr. Cell lysates were incubated with 1 mM probe 1 for 1 hr, followed by pull-down with streptavidin-agarose (SA; A and B) or by immunoprecipitation (IP) with Myc-tag antibody (C and D), then western blot analysis for the precipitated proteins and whole-cell lysates (WCL). (E) Tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the Cys173-containing tryptic peptide from recombinant Prx1 incubated with FB for 2 hr. The red character C rep- resents the Cys bound by FB. (F) Tandem mass spectrometry analysis of an FB-modiﬁed tryptic peptide from recombinant Grx3 incubated with FB for 2 hr. Since trypsin digestion produces the identical peptide CGFSK for both Cys159 and Cys261, the red character C represents the FB-modiﬁed Cys (Cys159 and/or Cys261) within this consensus sequence.
