Figure 2. FB and Active PNQ-Induced Cancer Cell Cytotoxicity Correlates with Inhibition of 4E-BP1 Phosphorylation (A) Growth for the indicated cell lines was assessed after 72 hr of treatment with various concentrations of FB. Results are expressed as the half-maximal growth inhibitory concentration (IC50) of FB. (B) HCT116 cells were treated with various concentrations of the indicated compounds for 72 hr. The viable cells were counted, and the results are presented as a percentage of viable cell number relative to DMSO-treated control cells. (C and D) HCT116 cells were treated with 2 mM of the indicated compounds (C) or with various concentrations of FB and 12 (D) for 12 hr followed by western blot analysis for the indicated proteins. (E) HCT116 cells were treated with various concentrations of FB and 12 for 72 hr. Apoptotic cells were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry, and the results are expressed as the increased levels of apoptosis by subtracting each of the DMSO-treated controls. (F) HCT116 cells with stable knockdown of 4E-BP1 and control cells were treated with 2 mM 12 for 72 hr followed by measuring apoptosis. (G) 4E-BP1/2 wild-type (WT) and double knockout (DKO) mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts were treated with various concentrations of 12 for 72 hr, and the results are presented as a percentage of viable cell number relative to DMSO-treated control cells. Data are shown as mean ± SEM (n = 3). *p < 0.001. See also Figures S2 and S3.
