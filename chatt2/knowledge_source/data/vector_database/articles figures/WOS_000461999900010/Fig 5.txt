Figure 6. Treatment with an Active FB Analog Suppresses Tumor Growth In Vivo (A) Synthesis of soluble prodrug 14 from 12. (B) Mice bearing HCT116 or DLD-1 CRC xenograft tumors were treated with 14 (14 mg/kg, ﬁve times per week) or vehicle control (n = 8 mice/group). (C) The mouse body weight was measured twice per week over the time course of the treatment in (B). (D) Western blot analysis of representative HCT116 tumors collected from mice in (B) 6 hr after the ﬁnal treatment with 14 or vehicle control. (E) A proposed model for the anticancer mechanism of FB through targeting Prx1/Grx3 to induce ROS accumulation leading to inhibition of mTORC1/4E-BP1- mediated translation and tumor growth. Data are shown as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.001 for 14 versus vehicle control; NS, not signiﬁcant. See also Figure S2.
