Figure 4. Classiﬁcation of CNZ-748 and analysis of the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). (A) Multilocus phylogeny of 21 single-copy marker genes with the closest related genomes in the GTDB database to CNZ-748. (B) Number of BGCs detected in each genome. BGCs observed in only one strain (singletons) are highlighted in green. (C) The grincamycin (gcn) BGC, a type 2 PKS (T2PKS), was only observed in CNZ-748 and is the only singleton in this strain. Functional annotation of the putative essential genes (orf1−orf30) in the CNZ-748 grincamycin BGC (gcn- CNZ748) based on BLASTp is presented in Table S2. (D) Comparative analysis of gcn-CNZ748 with the grincamycin BGC from Streptomyces lusitanus SCSIO LR32 (gcn-LR32) and the saquayamycin BGC from Streptomyces sp. KY40−1 (sqn). The percentages of homology shared between genes of the BGCs are shown in greyscale.
