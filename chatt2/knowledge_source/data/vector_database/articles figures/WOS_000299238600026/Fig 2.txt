Figure 3. Structures of the inverse epimeric pair constituting (2)-(1R,10RS,40RS,50SR)-alnumycin A17b,c (1) with an indica- tion of the expected label sites (*) arising from the feeding of [5-13C1(cid:1)5]-D-ribose and use of the recently described9 notation for indicating relative stereochemistry as an extension to the standard Natta projection system;10 the ’2’ near the C-10 atom and preceding the name indicates that the number of stereo- isomers present in the sample or under consideration is two.
