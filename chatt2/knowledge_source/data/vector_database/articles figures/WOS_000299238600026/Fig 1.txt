Figure 1. Schematic of the DEPT-PRJ pulse sequences with the additional segments comprising the PROJECT element shaded. In (a) is depicted the basic DEPT-PRJ pulse sequence wherein Δ1 = 1/(2 (cid:3) JH,C) as in normal DEPT acquisition or is cycled as per Jiang et al.4d (Δ1 = 1.384, 1.536, 2.173, 3.319 (cid:3) 2, 4.234, 5.331, and 7.041 ms) for the QDEPT-PRJ version (to span a JH,C range of 360(cid:1)70 Hz); the 1H-selection pulse can be set to an appropriate value (e.g., 45(cid:1)) as in normal DEPT acquisition or cycled through flip angles 35.3(cid:1), 48.0(cid:1), 50.6(cid:1), 78.5(cid:1), 87.5(cid:1), and 87.9(cid:1) as outlined by Jiang et al.4d for the QDEPT-PRJ version. In (b) is depicted the DEPT-PRJ.MULT pulse sequence with an optional number of spin echoes (n = 1, 2,... resulting in 2 þ 2n spin echoes). Similarly, Δ1 and the 1H-selection pulse can be set (e.g., to 1/(2 (cid:3) JH,C and 45(cid:1), respectively) as in normal DEPT acquisition or cycled methodically for the QDEPT-PRJ.MULT version. In both cases (a and b), Δ2 can be set independently of Δ1, typically in the range 1(cid:1)3 ms and all pulses common to the standard DEPT pulse sequence retained their original phases with the PROJECT pulses within the shaded sections possessing the same phase and phase incrementation as the preceding 180(cid:1) 13C-pulse (denoted by j).
