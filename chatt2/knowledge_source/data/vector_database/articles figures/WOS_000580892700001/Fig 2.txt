Figure 2. Tph1 (A), KatI (B), Kmo (C), and Kynu (D) messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs0 of rats non-exposed and exposed to CMS for two weeks (2 weeks unstressed, 2 weeks stress), in animals non-exposed to CMS for seven weeks and administered agomelatine (10 mg/kg) for ﬁve weeks (5 weeks agomelatine unstressed), and in animals exposed to CMS for seven weeks and administered vehicle (1 mL/kg) or agomelatine (10 mg/kg) for ﬁve weeks (7 weeks stressed/5 weeks saline and 7 weeks stressed/5 weeks agomelatine). Relative gene expression −∆Ct (Ctgene–Ct18S) method; n = 6; # p < 0.05 for diﬀerences between levels were estimated using the 2 2 weeks stressed and 2 weeks unstressed groups, * p < 0.05 for diﬀerences between 2 weeks stressed and 7 weeks stressed/5 weeks agomelatine groups.
