Figure 4. Methylation status of Tdo2 promoter 1 in the amygdala of CMS rats for two weeks (2 week unstress, 2 week stress) and in rats exposed to CMS for seven weeks and treated vehicle (1 mL/kg) or agomelatine (10 mg/kg) for ﬁve weeks (5 week agomelatine unstressed, 7 week stressed/5 week saline, and 7 week stressed/5 week agomelatine). Data represents means and min to max value. n = 6. * p < 0.05 for diﬀerences between 2 week stressed and 2 week unstressed groups.
