Figure 5. ACTB (A1), Tph1 (B1), Tph2 (C1), KatII (D1), and Ido1 (E1) protein expression in six brain structures of rats exposed to CMS for two weeks (2 weeks unstressed, 2 weeks stressed) and in animals exposed to CMS for seven weeks and administered vehicle (1 mL/kg) or agomelatine (10 mg/kg) for ﬁve weeks (5 weeks agomelatine unstressed, 7 weeks stressed/5 weeks saline, and 7 weeks stressed/5 weeks agomelatine). (I) Representative Western blot analysis in the hippocampus (H), amygdala (A), hypothalamus (HY), midbrain (M) cerebral cortex (CC), and basal ganglia (BG) of 2 weeks unstressed, 2 weeks stressed, 5 weeks agomelatine unstressed, 7 weeks stressed/5 weeks saline, and 7 weeks stressed/5 weeks agomelatine groups. (II) Levels of Tph1 (A2), Tph2 (B2), Ido1 (C2), and KatII (D2) proteins measured in hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus, midbrain, cortex, and basal ganglia. Samples containing 25 µg of proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The intensity of bands corresponding to Tph1, Tph2, Ido1, and KatII was analyzed by densitometry. Integrated optical density (IOD) was normalized by protein content and a reference sample (see Section 2 for details). The graphs show the mean IODs of the bands from all analyzed samples. The IODgene/IODACTB method was used to estimate the relative protein expression levels in the analyzed samples. Data represent means ± SEM; n = 6; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001 for diﬀerences between 2 weeks stressed and 2 weeks unstressed groups; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 for diﬀerences between 2 weeks stressed and 7 weeks stressed/5 weeks agomelatine; & p < 0.05 for diﬀerences between 7 weeks stressed/5 weeks saline and 7 weeks stressed/5 weeks agomelatine groups.
