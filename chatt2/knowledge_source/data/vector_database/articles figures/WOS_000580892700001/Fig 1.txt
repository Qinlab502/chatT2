Figure 1. The course of the experiment of chronic mild stress (CMS) and agomelatine therapy (A). Sucrose intake test in rats exposed to CMS for two weeks (week 2) and in animals exposed to CMS for seven weeks (week 7) and administered vehicle (1 mL/kg) or agomelatine (10 mg/kg) for ﬁve weeks (B). The consumption of 1.0% sucrose solution was measured in a 1 h test by weighing pre-weighed bottles. The data represent means ± standard error of the mean (SEM); n = 6; ## p < 0.01 relative to week 2 in the 2 weeks stressed group, & p < 0.05 relative to week 2 in the 5 weeks agomelatine unstressed group, ** p < 0.01 relative to week 2 in the 7 weeks stressed/5 weeks agomelatine group, *** p < 0.001 relative to week 7 in the 7 weeks stressed/5 weeks agomelatine group.
