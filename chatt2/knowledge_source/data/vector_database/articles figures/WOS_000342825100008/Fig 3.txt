Fig. 6. HPLC traces of in vitro reactions with (A) uracil and (B) juglone as substrates recorded at 280 and 425 nm, respectively. The previously conﬁrmed reactions of EcYeiN with D–ribose-5- phosphate and uracil [2,4], and AlnA with D–ribose-5-phosphate and juglone [11] serve as positive controls for the enzymatic reactions, whereas the negative control reactions (uracil and juglone) were performed in the absence of enzymes. The substrate juglone is not visible in the HPLC chromatograms because the reaction mixtures were extracted with chloroform during sample preparation and only the phosphoribosylated reaction product of AlnA and IdgA may be detected from the water phase analysed by HPLC. In addition, the phosphoribosylated juglone is not stable and dephosphorylates to juglone C–ribosylate also nonenzymatically [11]. These compounds may be separated from each other partially (see Fig. S2).
