Fig. 4. Analysis of gene conservation in the vicinity of PsiMP glycosidases. Most of the true PsiMP glycosidases contain a kinase gene homologous to YeiC in the same genomic loci, whereas non-PsiMP glycosidase gene clusters harbour a phosphatase of the haloacid dehalogenase family and a nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene. The putative PsiMP glycosidases that were tested experimentally in vitro are marked with an asterisk.
