Fig. 3. Phylogenetic tree of bacterial 16S rDNA sequences obtained from the strains harbouring PsiMP glycosidase genes. All sequences, including the outliers identiÔ¨Åed in the analysis of PsiMP glycosidases, are resolved according to the bacterial families. The colour coding is the same as in Fig. 2.
