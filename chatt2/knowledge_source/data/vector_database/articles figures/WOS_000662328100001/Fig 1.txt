Fig. 1. Structures and gene clusters of medermycin (MED, 1) and actinorhodin (ACT) and phylogenetic tree of Med-ORF10 homologues. A. Structures and producers of medermycin and actinorhodin. B. Gene clusters of medermycin and actinorhodin. med10 (med-ORF10) and actA (actVI-ORFA) were indicated in red. C. Phylogenetic tree of med-ORF10-homologs in antibiotic pathways. Their protein families and amino acid sequence identities to Med-ORF10 were shown as well. Their accession numbers in GenBank are AknV (AAF73458.1), SnoO (AAF01807.1), CnmX (CAE17525.1), PokC1 (ACN64848.1), DpsH (AAD04719.1), OxyI (AAZ78332.2), Med-ORF10 (BAC79038.1), Gra-ORF31 (CAA09658.1), ActVI-ORFA (NP_629222.1), FrnO (AAC18110.1), SnoaL (AAF01813), DnrD (AAA99000.1), AknH (AAF70112.1), SnoaL2 (2GEX_A), AclR (CAJ87106.1), DpsH (AD04719.1), ChaU (CAH10171.1), MtmX (CAA61988.1), Aln-ORF2 (ACI88858.1) and Caci_6494 (ACU75344.1).
