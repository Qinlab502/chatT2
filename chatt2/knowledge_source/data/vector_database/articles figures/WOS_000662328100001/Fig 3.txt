Fig. 4. Regulatory effects of med-ORF10 on expression levels of proposed targets. A. Transcriptional analysis of med-ORF12 in CH999/pIK340 and CH999/pIK340-Dmed10) by qRT-PCR. B. Translation analysis of med-ORF29 in AM-7161 and AM-7161/med10 was analysed by SDS-PAGE (upper panel) and Western blot (bottom panel). M, protein marker. Total protein samples were isolated from 2-, 3- and 4-day cultures respectively. C. The volcano plot of transcriptomics assay for differentially expressed native genes (non-med genes) between CH999/pIK340-Dmed10 versus CH999/pIK340 (mapped against the genome sequence of S. coelicolor A(3)2). The transcriptional level of different genes from CH999/pIK340 was normalized into 1. Differentially expressed genes are represented by red dots (upregulated) or green dots (downregulated) while blue dots represent genes without signiﬁcantly differential expression. The x-axis indicated the expression difference (P < 0.05 and log2(fold-change) > 1 or < (cid:1)1) of genes between CH999/pIK340 and CH999/pIK340-Dmed10 while y-axis represents the statistical signiﬁcance ((cid:1)log10(pval)) of expression difference. D. qRT-PCR analysis for partial upregulated genes in C. E. qRT-PCR analysis for partial downregulated genes in C.
