Fig. 2. Plasmid map of the vector pETR410 that was used for disruption of the naphthocyclinone cluster in S. arenae. (A) The organization of the chromosomal PKS genes before and after disruption by the thiostrepton gene. The lines below the PKS genes represent the expected size of the fragments hybridizing to the probe (4.5-kb BamHI fragment from pMM4) after digestion of chromosomal DNA with BamHI/EcoRV. (B) Southern blot of chromosomal DNA isolated from S. arenae wild-type ( lanes 1 and 3) and mutant ( lanes 2 and 4) digested with BamHI ( lanes 1 and 2) and BamHI/EcoRV ( lanes 3 and 4) hybridized with a 4.5-kb BamHI fragment from pKM4. M, l DNA digested with HindIII and digoxigenin labelled used as a standard.
