Figure 2.   Effect of β-rubromycin and γ-rubromycin on Ph. infestans cyst germination or direct germination from sporangia. The  indicated amount of each compound was added to sporangia or cysts, which were incubated at 10 °C for zoosporogenesis or 18 °C  for direct germination for indicated time period and then scored (A–D). (A) Representative images of cysts with or without 1.0 mg/L  β-rubromycin, showing the inhibition of cyst germination (at 6-h post stimulation of cyst germination). Bar is 50 μm. The indicated  amount of β-rubromycin or γ-rubromycin was added to sporangia (B and C). Cyst germination was scored at 6-h after addition of  a final concentration of 2.5 mM Ca(NO3)2 to zoospores. Comparison of the cyst germination rates in the presence of β-rubromycin  (B) and γ-rubromycin (C). (D) The indicated amount of β-rubromycin was added to cysts just after adding a final concentration  of 2.5 mM Ca(NO3)2 to zoospores, and which were incubated for 6 h at 18 °C and then cyst gemination was scored. (E) Effect of  β-rubromycin on germination from sporangia. The indicated amount of β-rubromycin was added to sporangia and kept at 25 °C to  assess the direct germination rate after 96 h. (F) Effect of β-rubromycin on hyphal elongation at 25 °C. The sporangium suspension  was kept at 25 °C with or without 1.0 mg/L β-rubromycin. The length of hyphae was measured under a microscope at indicated time  points. Letters indicate significant difference between groups (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA). Each experiment was performed three times  which contained three biological repeats.
