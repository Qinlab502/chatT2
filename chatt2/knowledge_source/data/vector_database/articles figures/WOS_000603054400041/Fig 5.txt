Figure 5.   Expression and phylogenetic analyses of RIO kinase-like genes. (A) qRT-PCR of PITG_04584 and  PITG_04591 expression in Ph. infestans with or without 1.0 mg/L β-rubromycin. Fold expression corresponds to  the ratio of the mean expression levels of their genes in the presence of 1.0 mg/L β-rubromycin divided by those  without β-rubromycin. The relative transcription levels are the means of at least three independent experiments,  and the error bars indicate standard deviations. *p < 0.05, Student’s t-test. (B) The phylogenetic relationship  of RIO kinase orthologs. Built is a consensus neighbor-joining tree based on sequences orthologous to  PITG_04584, PITG_04591, PITG_03672, and PITG_16813, based on an alignment performed using ClustalW.  The individual nodes of resulting trees was examined with 1000 bootstrap replicates; only values below 1000 are  shown.
