Figure 4.   Effect of β-rubromycin on germination and in planta growth of Py. aphanidermatum. (A) Effect of  1.0 mg/L β-rubromycin on cyst germination. Representative data after 10 h at 18 °C are provided. Bar is 50 μM.  (B)  IC50 of β-rubromycin for cyst germination at 10 h after cyst germination was stimulated. Each experiment  was performed three times which contained three biological repeats. (C) Effect of 1.0 mg/L β-rubromycin on  oospore germination after 24 h. Representative data are provided. Bar is 50 μM. (D)  IC50 of β-rubromycin for  oospore germination after 24 h. Each experiment was performed three times which contained three biological  repeats. (E) Effect of 1.0 mg/L β-rubromycin on in planta growth. Oospore (1.0 × 103) suspensions with or  without 1.0 mg/L β-rubromycin were added to wounded Chinese cabbage leaves (four straight cuts per leaf).  Representative images for three biological replicates at 4 days post-inoculation are presented.
