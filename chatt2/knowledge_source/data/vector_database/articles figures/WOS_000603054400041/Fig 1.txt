Figure 1.   Activity and LC–MS data of purified sample A. (A) HPLC profile indicating that the bioactive  fraction was at 15.38 min. (B) Effect of fractions on Ph. infestans cyst germination, showing that the peak from  panel A contains the inhibitor. The cyst germination rate under the control condition was set as 100%. (C) LC– MS data of Sample A purified from the isolated strain, Streptomyces sp. no. 750 (m/z = 0–1000).
