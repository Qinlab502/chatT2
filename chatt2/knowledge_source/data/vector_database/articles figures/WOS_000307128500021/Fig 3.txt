Fig. 8. The sub-spectral regions 3600–2900 cm(cid:3)1 and 1875–1525 cm(cid:3)1 covering the HAO, HAC, C@C, and C@O m bands for the two conformers of (R)-prealnumycin (4). Lower traces for the conformer with an axially oriented n-propyl group ( ). Vertical scaling is the same in each sub-region for the two conformations.
