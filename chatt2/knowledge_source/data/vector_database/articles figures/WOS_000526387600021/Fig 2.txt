Fig 2: Apoptosis induction by Urd E(7 µg/mL). a. Hoechst assay confirming nuclear  condensation Urd E treated cell lines compared to control. b. Western blot analysis of apoptotic  proteins in response to Urd E treatment. Cleavage of PARP and Caspase 9 were observed in  SiHa and MCF7 cell lines. Cleavage of Caspase 3 was observed in SiHa. Caspase 3 is absent in  MCF7 cell line. c. Cytochrome c release from mitochondria in Urd E treated SiHa cells  expressing cytochrome EGFP and Mito DsRed (Scale : 10µm).
