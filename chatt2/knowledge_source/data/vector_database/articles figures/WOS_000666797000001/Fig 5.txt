Representative pictures of the wounds are shown at days 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13. Wound closure progression during treatment with (B) 3b, (C) 3c, and (D) 3i. (E) Comparison of the effects of the optimal concentrations of 3b, 3c, and 3i on wound healing. 3b, 3c, and 3i are arranged in accordance with the speciﬁc concentration of each compound that was used in a gel applied to wounds in mice once per day for a total of 13 days.
