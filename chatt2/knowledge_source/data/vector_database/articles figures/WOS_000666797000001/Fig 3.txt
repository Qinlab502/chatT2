Figure 2. Representative images showing wound closures in HaCaT cells 0, 15, 18, and 24 h after wounding. Compounds 3b, 3c, 3i, 3l, and 3m were added to the medium to test their effects on wound healing (magniﬁcation: 4× objective). The groups with the strongest effects on cell migration are displayed in this ﬁgure. The remaining groups are shown in the supplementary materials.
