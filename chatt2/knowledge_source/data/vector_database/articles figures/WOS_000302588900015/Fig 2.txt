Figure 2. The Organization of the Xantholipin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster The gene cluster spans 52 kb and contains 49 ORFs. Genes are organized according to their proposed roles (see also Table 1); the underlined genes were individually inactivated, except for orf1–5, orf6–9, and xanY3–Y5, which were deleted together. The 40 kb gray part of fosmid 28B8 is the region that was deleted in strain ZWK1. The construction and veriﬁcation of the deletion mutants are shown in Figure S1.
