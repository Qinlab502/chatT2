Figure 4. Analysis of Antibiotic Production by S. Flavogriseus and Its Mutant Derivatives Top, UV spectra of compounds 1 (xantholipin, yellow), 6 (red), and 8a (yellow). Bottom, HPLC traces (274 nm UV absorption). The formulas of the compounds were given by Q-TOF Mass shown in Figure S3. Note, 8b was generated during the crystallization from methanol for X-ray analysis. See also Figure S5.
