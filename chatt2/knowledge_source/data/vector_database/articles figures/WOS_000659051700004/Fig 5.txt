Figure 5b depicts the distribution concentration of CA in  major tissues of mice including heart, liver, spleen, lung,  kidney,  brain,  skeletal  muscle  after  oral  dose  of  50  mg/ kg  of  either   Na2GA/CA-BM  or  CA.  After  intragastric  administration for 2 h, the concentration of CA  (Na2GA/ CA-BM  group)  was  high  in  spleen,  and  reached  to  the  highest blood concentration at 6 h, after that CA gradu- ally cleared and finally expelled at about 12 h. As for free  CA  group,  CA  was  distributed  mainly  in  spleen,  liver,  lung,  kidney  and  muscle,  and  slowly  cleared  after  12  h.  The  main  metabolic  organ  of  CA  was  liver  and  spleen,  while  Na2GA/CA-BM was metabolized mainly in spleen  after  6  h.  Generally,  large  size  of  particles  were  prefer- entially  absorbed  by  the  liver,  and  small  particles  were  easily  cleared  by  the  spleen,  which  led  to  the  change  in  metabolic  site  of  drug  [36,  37].  In  comparison,   Na2GA/ CA-BM showed longer blood accumulation in body than  free CA after 12 h, which was consistent with the results  of the pharmacokinetic study.
