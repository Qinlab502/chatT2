Figure 4. Waters Synapt HDMS ion mobility mass spectra of a mixture of fractions B and H. (a) drift plot of a mixture of the two frac- tions. (b) Mobility of the two anthracyclines. The ion (1) with a drift time of 3.98 ms was confirmed as fraction B in experiments where  each fraction was analysed separately, and ion (2) at 4.95 ms was from fraction H. (c) ESI mass spectra of peaks at drift time 3.98 ms (1)  and 4.95 ms (2).
