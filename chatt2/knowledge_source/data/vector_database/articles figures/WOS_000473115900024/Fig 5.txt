Figure 5. Summary of kyc cluster orf expression profiles in WMMB235/WMMA185 co-culture compared to  those generated in WMMB235 monoculture. Out of 49 orfs within the kyc cluster, only 6 undergo less than  a 4-fold increase in expression and two (kyc30, 31 in red) appear to  be suppressed  in co-culture. That  these orfs appear to be dispersed at 3-4 different groupings within the kyc cluster suggests that kyc cluster  regulation calls for more than just one global regulator. Beyond the earlier stated orf-to-function projections,  a comprehensive listing of kyc genes and their putative roles in keyicin biosynthesis is provided in Table  S3 of Supporting Information. FC, fold change. False Discovery Rate (q-value) for each gene expression  change <<0.01.
