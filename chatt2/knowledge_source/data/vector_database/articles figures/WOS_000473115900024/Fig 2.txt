Figure 2. AHL inducers of keyicin. (a)  Six out of 96 AHLs screened for kyc  cluster  activation  and  subsequent  keyicin production: 2 and 3 are natural  AHLs whereas 4â€“7 are synthetic. (b)  Increase in keyicin production shown  as  positive  log  fold  change  in  the  absorbance  at  470  nm  on  treatment  with  AHLs  compared  to  untreated  monoculture;  absorbance  at  470  nm  also  enables  detection  of  aglycone- containing precursors to 1. Co-culture  with  WMMA185  shown  as  positive  control (red bar). AHLs 2 and 3 are the  native LuxR signals in P. aeruginosa  and V. fischeri, respectively.3
