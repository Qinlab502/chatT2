Figure 4. GNPS and Cytoscape visualization of keyicin analog masses (from LC-MS/MS of co-cultured  WMMB235)  reflect  varying  extents  of  glycosylation  over  time  (days  2,  5,  8,  and  14).  Continuous  color  mapping for each node in the network represent the relative concentrations of the species for which MS  data is shown. Color intensities correlate to concentrations of each species for which MS data is acquired.  The m/z signal for keyicin (805.347) is indicated at each time point with a thick diagonal arrow.
