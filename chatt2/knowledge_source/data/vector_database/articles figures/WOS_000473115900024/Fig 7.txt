Figure 8.  Summary of KEGG mapping for WMMB235 monoculture versus co-culture with WMMA185.  Lane contents are shown by combination of bracketing and lane coding below the categories listing. Co- culturing  and  duration  of  fermentations  both  impact  gene  expression  within  WMMB235.  Categories  of  function not abundant enough to depict graphically involved cell communication, cell motility, and signal  molecules and interaction. All other categories are depicted in one or more of lanes 1â€“4.
