Figure 2. Structure-based multiple-sequence alignment of LanV, the related angucycline 6-ketoreductases CabV, PgaMred, and UrdMred, the type II ketoreductases ActKR and HedKR, and the modular type I ketoreductases EryKR1 and AmpKR2. Only the catalytic domains of EryKR1 and AmpKR2 are included in the alignment.45,47 The sequence motifs for NADP+ binding and catalysis are highlighted in pink. The regions in contact with rings C and D of the ligand are highlighted in turquoise. Regions near rings A and B are highlighted in orange. The extended loop region after Î±3 in C6-ketoreductases and the lid region of type I and type II ketoreductases are highlighted in green. Residues discussed in the context of the stereoselectivity of the reaction are denoted with stars.
