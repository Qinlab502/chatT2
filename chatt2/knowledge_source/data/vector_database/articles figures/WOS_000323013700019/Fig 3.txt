Figure 3. Molecular architectures of ligand and cosubstrate binding sites of LanV. (A) Binding of NADP+ and acetic acid to LanV at 1.65 Å resolution (σ = 1.0). (B) Hydrogen bonding network to the 2′- phosphate group of the adenine unit of NADP+ depicted in angstroms. (C) Amino acid residues responsible for shaping the hydrophobic active site of LanV. The residue Ser192 could be observed in two alternative conformations. (D) View of the active site of LanV with the catalytic residues Ser147, Tyr160, and Lys164 highlighted and the hydrogen bonding distance to the catalytic water molecule shown. The electron density of 11-deoxylandomycinone (σ = 1.0) could be best ﬁt with a 6-keto form of the compound. The ligands and cosubstrates − Fc) were omitted from calculation of the electron density maps (2Fo to reduce model bias.
