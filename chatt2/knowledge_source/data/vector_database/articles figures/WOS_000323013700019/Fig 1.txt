Figure 1. Stereoview images of the overall structure of the landomycin 6-ketoreductase LanV. (A) The Rossmann fold of the LanV monomer provides a binding site for NADP+ on top of the β-sheet secondary structure. (B) Structure of the LanV tetramer. (C) Surface view of LanV with calculated electrostatics demonstrating the hydrophobic binding site of the ligand. The surface is colored according to the electrostatic potential at 23 °C (−22 to 22 kT/e) with positive potential colored blue and negative potential colored red.
