Figure 6. Proposed reaction mechanism of LanV. The catalysis of the 6-ketoreduction starts with the transfer of a proton from Tyr160 via a coordinated water molecule to the 6-carbonyl of the substrate, and the 4-pro-S hydride of the NADPH is transferred to C-6 of the substrate. The proton relay system is likely to involve the 2′-hydroxyl group of the ribose unit of NADPH and the ε-amino group of Lys164, in addition to the hydroxyl group of Tyr160 and the coordinated water molecule. R is adenoside-2′-phosphate-5′-diphosphate.
