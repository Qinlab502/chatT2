Figure 4. HPLC chromatograms of in vitro reactions conducted with prejadomycin as a substrate monitored at 428 nm and structures of the reaction products 11-deoxylandomycinone and gaudimycin C with 6R and 6S stereochemistry, respectively. (A) Control reaction with PgaE and LanV producing 11-deoxylandomycinone. (B) Reaction with PgaE and the LanV Tyr160Ala variant that does not lead to formation of 11- deoxylandomycinone. In the absence of a functional 6-ketoreductase, the reaction product of PgaE degrades in solution.17,18 (C) Reaction with PgaE and LanV Ser192Ile producing both gaudimycin C and 11- deoxylandomycinone in a 1:3 ratio. (D) Control reaction with PgaE and CabV producing gaudimycin C.
