Fig. 2 Example of relations retrieved from the LeGOO base, depicted using a graph representation, here using the MtEFD transcription factor as a query. The relation types along with associated information are indicated on the edges and depicted with different colors (e.g. blue for represses and yellow for induces). Additional information (such as experimental conditions, a link to the corresponding publication. . .) can be found on a panel on the side of the graph. Dashed lines indicate several relations of the same type; details on those relations can be obtained by expanding the synonymous nodes (‘Synonymous Display’ menu).
