Fig. 3 Example of shortest paths (top right panel) found between two proteins (MtEFD and MtDME; number of paths set to Ô¨Åve). A contextual menu (long click on any object; here Mt0127_00021) gives access to the Mt5.0 genome browser and numerous associated data: here Mt5.0 and Mt4.0 gene models, Affymetrix and Nimblegen gene probe location, position of TnT1 insertions in the TnT1 mutant population (Tadege et al. 2008, Cheng et al. 2011), nodule and root RNAseq data; three bottom right panels: information on functional gene annotation accessed through a right-click on the Mt5.0 gene model, with links to different databases (here ThaleMine, to access information on A. thaliana BLASTP hits).
