Fig. 1 Example of various identiﬁers (ESTs, microarray probes and locus from different genome sequence releases) corresponding to the same gene, MtEFD (Ethylene response Factor required for nodule Differentiation; Vernie´ et al. 2008). (a) The mapping of different datasets (Mt4.0, Mt20120830 genomes, Affymetrix and Nimblegen probes and MtGI ESTs) onto the Mt5.0 genome sequence. Based on the strandedness and overlapping coverage of each pair of sequences, synonymy links are added to the LeGOO ID converter database as shown in (b).
