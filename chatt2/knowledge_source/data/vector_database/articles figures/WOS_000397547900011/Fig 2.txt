Figure 2 Biosynthesis of isofuranonaphthoquinones (IFQs) and the origin and biosynthetic relationship of isoindolequinones (IIQs) to IFQs. (a) Genetic organization and comparison of conﬁrmed (ifn from Streptomyces sp. RI-77), proposed (ifq from Streptomyces sp. CB01883) and putative (‘ifq’ from Streptomyces sp. CF386) gene clusters for IFQ biosynthesis. (b) A uniﬁed pathway for IFQ biosynthesis, featuring common intermediates 12, 13, 14 and 15 and divergence from 15 to JBIR-76 and JBIR-77 in Streptomyces sp. RI77 and 1–6 in Streptomyces sp. CB01883, as well as chemical transformation of IFQs in the presence of amines to account for IIQ formation.
