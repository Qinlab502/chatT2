Fig. 3 SDS-PAGE of puriﬁed His-tagged-Med-ORF10 fusion pro- tein. Lane 1, puriﬁed protein after Ni afﬁnity chromatography; lane 2, puriﬁed protein after gel ﬁltration; M molecular weight standards (kDa). 16 lL of puriﬁed protein samples (0.2 lg/lL) were mixed with 4 lL 59 SDS loading buffer (250 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 10 % SDS, 0.5 % bromophenol blue, 50 % glycerol, 5 % b-ME) and heated at then loaded to one well of 10 % SDS-PAGE 95 (cid:3)C for 5 min, minigel. The original buffers of samples were as follows: 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole for lane 1 and 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT for lane 2
