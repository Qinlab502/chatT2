Fig. 2 SDS-PAGE analysis of Med-ORF10 expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Lane 1, uninduced whole cell proteins of E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pET28a-His-med-10; lane 2, induced whole cell proteins of E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pET28a-His-med-10; lane 3, induced whole cell proteins of E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pET28a; M molecular weight standards (kDa). All the protein samples were prepared by adding 100 lL 19 SDS loading buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 2 % SDS, 0.1 % bromophenol blue, 10 % glycerol, 1 % b-ME) to 1 mL cell culture pellet and 20 lL protein samples were loaded to one well of 10 % SDS-PAGE minigel after heating at 95 (cid:3)C for 5 min and centrifuging at 13,000 rpm, 4 (cid:3)C for 10 min
