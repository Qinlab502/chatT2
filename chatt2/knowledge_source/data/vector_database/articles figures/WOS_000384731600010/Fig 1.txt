Figure 2. Crystal Structure of SimC7 (A and B) SimC7 displayed as (A) a molecular surface and (B) cartoon representation with the nucleotide binding domain, the substrate binding domain, and the lid motif shown in pale blue, beige, and magenta, respectively. Ligands are represented as van der Waals spheres with the 7-oxo-SD8 substrate shown in yellow and the cofactor shown in green. (C) Close-up showing conformational changes in the lid between the apo (chain A, form 2; blue), the binary complex (salmon), and the ternary complex (magenta); the core protein structure and ligands shown represent the ternary complex. C-4 of the cofactor and C-7 of the substrate are highlighted by black spheres, showing that C-7 of the substrate is exactly positioned 3 A˚ from C-4 of the nicotinamide ring, poised for direct hydride transfer. (D and E) Orthogonal close-ups showing the active site of the ternary complex including the Ser95-Ile108-His112 ‘‘catalytic triad’’ residues, and Asn137, which is important in maintaining the syn conformation of the cofactor. For clarity, only the angucyclic polyketide moiety of the substrate is shown. Hydrogen bonds are shown as dashed lines. (E) is also reproduced as a stereo image in Figures S3A and S3B, which also show a difference electron density map calculated from the ﬁnal model after simulated annealing reﬁnement with the substrate omitted.
