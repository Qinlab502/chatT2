Fig. 2 The mutagenesis strategy and fermentation proﬁles of the Δnes18 mutant and structures of the isolated compounds. The Δnes18 mutant was constructed by insertional mutagenesis, and comparative HPLC analysis of the metabolite proﬁles was carried out for (i) the wild type (WT) strain M. echinospora SCSIO 04089; (ii) the Δnes18 mutant; and (iii) the acid hydrolysis product of 2. Structures of 2–4 are also shown.
