Fig. 4. Protein biosynthesis inhibition by tetracycline and chelocardin. L-[35S]methionine incorporation rates into proteins of B. subtilis 168 during the 5 min pulse after treatment with 5.5 μg/ml tetracycline (TET), or 3, 6, or 12 μg/ml chelocardin (CHD), were determined. L-[35S]methionine incorporation into protein of untreated controls was set to 100%. Values represent the average over three biological replicates.
