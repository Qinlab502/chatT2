Fig. 7. Test for pore formation in B. subtilis cells after treatment with 5.5 and 55 μg/ml tetracycline (TET), 3, 6, or 12 μg/ml chelocardin (CHD), or 2 μg/ml nisin (NIS). SYTO 9, a green ﬂuorescent dye, stains all cells and propidium iodide, a red ﬂuorescent dye, only stains cells with membrane pores. Overlays of the green and red ﬂuorescence images are shown. Nisin served as a positive control for pore formation.
