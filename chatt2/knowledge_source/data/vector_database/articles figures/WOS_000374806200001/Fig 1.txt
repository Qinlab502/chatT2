Fig. 1. Growth of B. subtilis after antibiotic stress. Exponentially growing B. subtilis cells were treated with 5.5 or 110 μg/ml tetracycline (TET) (A) and with 3, 6, 12, or 30 μg/ml chelocardin (CHD) (B). Arrowheads indicate the time of antibiotic addition. Colony forming units are presented relative to the control culture before treatment (con t0) with 5.5 or 110 μg/ml tetracycline (TET), or with 3, 6, 12, or 30 μg/ml chelocardin (CHD) (C).
