Fig. 2. Proteome proﬁles of B. subtilis showing newly synthesized proteins after antibiotic stress with 5.5 μg/ml tetracycline (A), or 3 (B), 6 (C), or 12 (D) μg/ml chelocardin. Pulse-labeled cytosolic proteins were separated by pI and molecular mass using 2D-PAGE. The proteome proﬁles of untreated cells (green) were overlaid with the proﬁle of cells treated with tetracycline or chelocardin (red). Red spots indicate upregulated proteins, green spots indicate down-regulated proteins, and yellow spots indicate proteins synthesized under both conditions. Arrowheads mark proteins that were at least two-fold induced in all three biological replicates and identiﬁed by mass spectrometry. All marker proteins including the unidentiﬁed ones are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1.
