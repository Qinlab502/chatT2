Fig. 6. Analysis of membrane depolarization in B. subtilis treated with 5.5 μg/ml tetracycline (TET), 3, 6, or 12 μg/ml chelocardin (CHD), 10 μg/ml valinomycin (VAL), or 2.5 μg/ml nisin (NIS) using the potential-sensitive ﬂuorescent dye DiSC3(5). Valinomycin and nisin serve as positive controls for membrane depolarization. Relative ﬂuorescence was observed over a 10 min time period. DiSC3(5) was added at 60 s, and antibiotics were added at 240 s. An increase in relative ﬂuorescence reﬂects the depolarization of the membrane. The measurements were repeated at least three times and representative data are shown.
