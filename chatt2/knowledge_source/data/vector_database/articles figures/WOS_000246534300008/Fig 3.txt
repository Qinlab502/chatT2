Figure 3. A) Amino acid (AA) sequence identities of novel putative halogen- ases that were identified in this study in comparison to halogenases which are thought to be involved in the halogenation of the respective reference compounds. The halogenase sequence-based prediction of the respective compound class putatively produced by each individual strain, and a corre- sponding reference compound is indicated. Because no xanthone-specific halogenase has been published prior to this study, the novel halogenase 2544 and the corresponding metabolite CBS40 were used as references for further comparison of similar enzymes and compounds. Novel putative halo- genases are designated by referring to the corresponding strain collection number. B) Phylogenetic tree comprising of 29 published halogenase se- quences (marked in orange) and 103 novel putative halogenase fragments, which were identified in this study. Strains with the biosynthetic potential to produce predictable compound classes are indicated by a green circle. A strain which contains halogenase no. 2544, which is involved in the synthe- sis of a xanthone antibiotic, is marked by a blue quadrangle. Two large sub- families without published halogenase sequences are marked in grey. Puta- tive macrolide antibiotic-producer strains are marked by purple pentagons; Their identity is based on the sequencing of adjacent genes and hybridizing experiments.
