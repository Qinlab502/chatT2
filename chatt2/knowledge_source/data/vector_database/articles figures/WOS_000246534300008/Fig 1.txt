Figure 1. Sequence alignment of approximately 280 N-terminal amino acids of six selected FADH2-dependent halogenases that are known to be involved in the chlorination of the corresponding metabolites. Residue numbers for each protein correspond to their sequences, which were primarily deposited in the database (accession numbers: Avilamycin: AX535360; Simocyclinone: personal communication Prof A. Bechthold; Balhimycin: CAA76550; Complestatin: AAK81830; Ansamitocin: AAM54090; Calicheamicin: AAM70353). Protein regions that have been used for the design of the conserved primer Halo-B4-FW and Halo-B7-RV are highlighted in grey and the corresponding nucleotide sequences of the primers are shown. “*” means that the residues in that column are identical in all sequences in the alignment. “:”, ”.” means that conserved and semiconserved substitutions are observed, respectively.
