Figure 5. HPLCâ€“MS analyses of the products of three putative GPA-producing wild-type strains that were newly identified in this study (for screening and analysis details see the Experimental Section). Mass spectra of super- Gnatants, including the analyses of the isotopic pattern; compound variants with a Na-specific mass shift of D = 22 amu are highlighted. A) Mass spectrum of the supernatant of strain Cb2429, which shows the production of a monochlorinated substance with a mass of m/z = 1560. B) Mass spectrum of the supernatant of strain Cb2023, which most likely produces a dichlorinated compound with a mass of m/z 1135. C) Mass spectrum of the super- Gnatant of strain Cb2364, which produces the monochlorinated substance CB2364-I. An identical substance is pro- duced by strain Cb2429 (see Figure 4 A), which originates from a different strain of the strain collection.
