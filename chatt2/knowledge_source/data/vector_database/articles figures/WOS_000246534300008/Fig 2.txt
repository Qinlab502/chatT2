Figure 2. Phylogenetic tree constructed from halogenase sequences that were reported in the literature, or deposited in public databases. Sequences of halo- genases marked in orange were used to design the primer pair Halo-B4-FW and Halo-B7-RV (Figure 1). Metabolites that correspond to highlighted halogenas- es are shown.
