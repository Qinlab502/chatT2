Fig. 9. Changes of ABTS(cid:121)+ absorbance at 730 nm monitored after mix- ing  of  200  μl  of  sample  in  DMSO  with  2.8  ml  of  aqueous  solutions  of  ABTS(cid:121)+ (c0=80 μM). In reference experiments the samples were replaced  by  DMSO  solvent.  Concentration  of  samples  in  DMSO  solutions  in  mg/ml: 8-OMTGM: 1; E: 1.3; E2: 1.5.
