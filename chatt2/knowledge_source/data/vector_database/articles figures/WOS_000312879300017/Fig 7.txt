Fig. 7. Time course of EPR integral intensities (IEPR) of DMPO spin ad- ducts  observed  in  air-saturated  solutions  for  the  reference  system  ((cid:401));  and in the presence of 8-OMTGM ((cid:404)); extract (E1) isolated from Strepto- myces sp. AC37 ((cid:60177)); extract (E2) isolated from AC37-9M-16 (×). The data  were  obtained  after  double  integration  of  EPR  spectra  shown  in  Fig. 6.  Right axis illustrates the evaluation of Radical Scavenging Capacity (RSC)  as “% of scavenged radicals” after 22 min incubation at 60°C.
