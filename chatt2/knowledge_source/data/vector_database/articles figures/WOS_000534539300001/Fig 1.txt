Fig. 3 Genetic receptor status in pre-treatment and NACT TNBC samples. a Representative agarose gel showing absence of amplification of FZD7 in all samples tested based on relative band intensity calculation. β2-microglobulin (B2M) was used as control. M: pUC19/MspI-digested molecular marker. b Representative electropherogram showing amplification of LRP6 in sample # 2383T[(3880.5/1048.7)/(3995.94/ 4005.75) = 3.73 > 2.4–2.6], but no amplification was found in sample # 529T[(3555.19/3588.19)/(3070.83/3523.09) = 1.13 < 2.4–2.6] based on relative band intensity calculation. The arrow indicates the amplified
