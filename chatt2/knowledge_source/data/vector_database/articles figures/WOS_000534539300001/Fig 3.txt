Fig. 6 Validation of antagonist gene promoter hypomethylation in MDA-MB-231 cells. Representative histogram of quantitative p r o m o t e r m e t h y l a t i o n a n a l y s i s s h o w i n g t h e l e v e l s o f hypomethylation of SFRP1, SFRP2 and DKK1 with increasing concentrations of a doxorubicin and b nogalamycin in MDA- MB-231 cells. Representative qRT-PCR plots showing increased fold changes (mean ± SD) in the expression of SFRP1, SFRP2 and DKK1 relative to the corresponding untreated controls after normalization to β2-microglobulin using the 2^−ddCt method in MDA-MB-231 cells after treatment with c doxorubicin and e nogalamycin. Graphical presentation of the qRT-PCR analysis showing a decreased fold changes (mean ± SD) in expression of the FZD7 and LRP6 receptors with respect to the corresponding untreated controls after normalization to β2-microglobulin using the 2^−ddCt method in MDA-MB-231 cells after treatment with d doxorubicin and f nogalamycin. g Representative Western blot
