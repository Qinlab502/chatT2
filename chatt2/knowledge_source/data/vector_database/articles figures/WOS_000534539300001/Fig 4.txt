Fig. 7 Kaplan-Meier survival analyses in pre-treatment and NACT TNBC samples. Kaplan-Meier 5-year survival probability curves of pre-treatment TNBC patients with a high/low expression of a FZD7, b LRP6 and g total nuclear beta-catenin and with/without alterations (deletion/methylation) of the c DKK1, d SFR1 and e SFRP2 genes. Kaplan-Meier 5-year survival probability curves of pre-treatment TNBC patients with co-expression of f LRP6 and DKK1 and h FZD7, LRP6 and beta-catenin. Kaplan-Meier 5-year survival probability curves
