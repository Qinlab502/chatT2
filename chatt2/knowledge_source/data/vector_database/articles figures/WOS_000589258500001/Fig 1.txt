Figure 1. Silkworm-killing ability of four mycobacteria. A suspension of four mycobacteria strains was diluted to the indicated cell number and injected into the silkworm hemolymph. Infected silkworms C. The number of surviving silkworms was counted 70 h after the injection. were incubated at 37 (cid:7): M. avium JCM15430 (6.0 × 107 CFU/larva); (cid:4): M. intracellulare JCM6384 (7.0 × 108 CFU/larva); (cid:52): M. avium + M. intracellulare (1.8 × 108 + 3.5 × 108 CFU/larva); : M. bovis BCG Pasteur (5.0 × 108 CFU/larva); (cid:3): My. abscessus ATCC19977 (1.5 × 108 CFU/larva). Experiments were performed three times and reproducible data were observed.
