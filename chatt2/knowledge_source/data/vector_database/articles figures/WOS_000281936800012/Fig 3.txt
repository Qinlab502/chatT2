Fig. 3. Dimer-selective natural product extract SB83e was fractionated, and the constituent compound responsible for dimer selectivity was identiﬁed and puriﬁed. (a) BRET assays showing the dimer selectivity of actinopolymorphol A for ERb/b and ERa/b. (b) ERE-luciferase assays in HEK293 cells showing the ability of actinopolymorphol A to induce the transcription of ERa alone (ERa homodimers), ERb alone (ERb homodimers), or ERa + ERb (all three dimer pairs). The transcriptional response is ablated by the ER antagonist ICI 182,780. Error bars represent standard deviations from the mean.
