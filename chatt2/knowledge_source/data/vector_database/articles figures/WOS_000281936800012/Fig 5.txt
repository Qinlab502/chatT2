Fig. 5. The synthetic actinopolymorphol A inhibits cell growth. (a) ERa and ERb expression in PC3 and HC11 cells was conÔ¨Årmed via semi-quantitative RT-PCR (left panel) and Western blotting (right panel). b-Actin served as a loading control. (b) Cell growth and viability were decreased by treatment with the synthetic actinopolymorphol A in both cell lines as determined by cell counting and Trypan blue staining. Error bars represent standard deviations from the mean.
