Fig. 7. Comparison of predicted binding mode of actinopolymorphol A and binding mode of 17b-estradiol from crystal structure. (a and d) Superimposition of actinopolymorphol A and 17b-estradiol in the ligand binding domain of ERa (a) and ERb (d). (b and e) Important interaction between estradiol and residues in the ligand binding pocket of ERa (b) and ERb (e). (c and f) Important interactions between actinopolymorphol A and residues in the ligand binding pocket of ERa (c) and ERb (f). The hydrogen bonds were shown as yellow dash line.
