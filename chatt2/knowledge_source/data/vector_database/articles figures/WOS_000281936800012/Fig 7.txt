Fig. 6. Fluorescence Polarization Competition Binding Assays for ERa and ERb. (a) Genistein binds to ERa and ERb with different afﬁnities consistent with previous reports and served as a positive control for the Fluorescence Polarization Competition Binding Assay. (b) The synthetic actinopolymorphol A binds to ERb with 2-fold higher afﬁnity than to ERa.
