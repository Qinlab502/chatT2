Fig. 3. Superposition of the amino acid sequence of BenQ (green) onto the structure of ZhuH (cyan) highlighting the putative binding pockets at loop 3 (L3). The protrudent amino acid residues His86 and Met90(cid:4) (from its counterpart of the dimer) of BenQ may be determinants for substrate speciﬁcity. (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of the article.)
