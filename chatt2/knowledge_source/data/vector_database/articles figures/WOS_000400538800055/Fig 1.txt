Figure 2. Gene map of biosynthetic gene clusters associated with the biosynthesis of cosmomycins C and D. The cosmomycin BGCs from (A) Streptomyces sp. CNS-615, (B) Streptomyces sp. CNT-302, and (C) Streptomyces olindensis are >90% similar on the amino acid sequence level. A gene- by-gene comparison can be found in Table S2. Homology of the Streptomyces sp. CNT-302 and the S. olindensis BGCs is restricted to the ﬁrst 40 kb of the captured sequence (denoted by dotted lines), suggesting the last 14 kb of genomic material captured in this study is not necessary for cosmomycin production. Genes marked with a “*” have been interrogated by gene knockout experiments in previous studies.
