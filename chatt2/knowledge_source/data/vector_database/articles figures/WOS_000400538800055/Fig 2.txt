Figure 3. Cosmomycin cluster identiÔ¨Åed by molecular networking. Nodes matching the masses for cosmomycins C (1) and D (2) network with nodes matching values of cosmomycin derivatives lacking methyl groups and/or oxygen. These include deoxycosmomycin C (3), desmethylcosmomycin C (A), and desmethyl-deoxycosmomycin C (B).
