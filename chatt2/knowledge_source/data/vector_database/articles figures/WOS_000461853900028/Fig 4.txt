Figure 5. E⁰′ and ΔG⁰′ for free and NMO-bound dithranol− have similar values. CV was run using A)  1 mM  dithranol− and B) 1 mM  NMO-dithranol− complex in air-saturated buffer (CAPS-ME, 30% (v/v)  glycerol,  pH  9.8)  at  25  °C.  The  arrow  indicates  the  scan  direction  (in  the  oxidative  direction).  EP,  the  potential where the current reaches a maximum, was used in equation (10) to determine the standard cell  redox potential of dithranol oxidation. E⁰′ for free and bound dithranol− -0.048 ± 0.007 and +0.037 ± 0.01  V, respectively. To calculate the standard free energy of electron transfer from dithranol− to O2, equation  (9) was used: ΔG⁰′ free dithranol− = 7.4 ± 0.2 and bound dithranol− = 9.4 ± 0.3. Binding the substrate to  WT NMO makes the reaction more endothermic by 2.0 kcal mol-1.
