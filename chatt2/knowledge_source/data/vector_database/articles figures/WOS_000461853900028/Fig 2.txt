Figure 2. Second order rate constants for the uncatalyzed reaction between dithranol− and O2 were  measured  as a function  of  increasing temperature.  The  method  of  initial rates  for  pseudo-first  order  reactions  was  used  to  determine  k´  for  dithranol−  oxidation  at  210-280  (black  circles),  460-550  (red  diamonds), 710-850 (green triangles), and 940-1175 (blue squares) µM O2 in CAPS-ME, pH 9.8 at A) 10  °C, B) 15 °C, C) 20 °C, and D) 25 °C. The reactions were stirred under constant [O2], with the green arrow  showing increasing [O2]. The slope of the line for [dith]t/[dith]0 vs time gives k´ (eq 7). Error bars represent  ±1 standard deviation of three or more independent experiments for each time point.
