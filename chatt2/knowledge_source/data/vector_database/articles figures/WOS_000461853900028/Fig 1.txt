Figure 1. NMO lowers the pKa of dithranol. Spectrophotometric titrations of A) 50 µM dithranol or B)  the NMO-dithranol complex (100 µM dithranol + 150 µM WT NMO) in buffer over pH 5.8-10.9 reveal  that NMO lowers the pKa by 1.0 unit. All pH titrations were performed by a discontinuous method using a  different buffer for each pH due to instability of the enzyme when concentrated acid or base is added. See  methods for buffers used. The pH 5.8 (dotted black line) and pH 10.9 spectra (solid black) are highlighted.  Insets: The absorbance at 354 nm (black circles) and 440 nm (red squares) is plotted versus pH and fit to a  sigmoidal curve to obtain values for pKa (eq 2): 7.9 ± 0.4 (free dithranol) and 6.9 ± 0.2 (NMO-dithranol  complex). Error bars represent ±1 standard deviation of three or more independent titrations.
