Figure 6. NMO active site pocket has residues that are conserved across the ABM superfamily. The  crystal structure of the active site cavity of WT NMO is shown, with ethylene glycol bound (PDB code:  3KG0). NMO contains a very hydrophobic active site, with several amino acids that are conserved across  other members of the ABM superfamily. These include N18, N63, F82, and W67 (17), shown in gold. The  latter is the only strictly conserved residue amongst ABMs. Although mutation of this residue results in  severely diminished activity (11), its role has yet to be elucidated. Also shown are the two water molecules  that flank N18 (W188) and N63 (W130), which are 2.8 and 3.0 Ã…, respectively; they may play a role in the  deprotonation of dithranol and lowering the pKa.
