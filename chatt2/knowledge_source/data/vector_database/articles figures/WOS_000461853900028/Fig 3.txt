Figure 4. Michaelis-Menten curves for NMO-catalyzed dithranol− oxidation at varying temperatures.  Initial rates for dithranol− oxidation in the presence of 4 μM NMO in buffer (CAPS-ME, pH 9.8) were  measured as a function of O2 concentration and fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation (eq 8). Dithranol− was  saturating (≥5x KM) at 500 μM, and the O2 consumption was monitored via O2 electrode with respect to  [O2] at 5 (red triangles), 10 (black circles), 15 (green triangles), 20 (blue squares), 25 (teal right angles), 30  (pink  angles),  and  37  (orange  inverted  triangles)  °C.  As  expected,  the  rate  increases  with  increasing  temperature (represented by the arrow). Error bars represent the error in the slope from the linear regressions  of three or more runs.
