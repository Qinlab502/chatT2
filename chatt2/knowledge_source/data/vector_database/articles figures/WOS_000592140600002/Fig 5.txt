Fig. 6 Binding-guided isolation of actinomycin V (9). a HPLC chromatograms of fractions from RM1-1 extract at 254-nm wave- length. b Binding analysis of fractions. Fractions 5 (orange) and 6 (purple) show binding to GC- and AT-rich DNA. c Fraction 6 (purple) shows one major component identified as actinomycin V (9). d Purified ac- tinomycin V (9) binding to GC- and AT-rich DNA at 0.25, 0.50, 1.00, 2.00, 4.00, 6.00, 8.00, and 10.00 Î¼M
