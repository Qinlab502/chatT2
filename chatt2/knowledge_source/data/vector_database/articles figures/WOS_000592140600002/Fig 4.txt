Fig. 5 Identification and isolation of the DNA intercalator echinomycin (8) from microbial extract screening. a HPLC chromatogram of fractions from Streptomyces strain O1/8 at 254- nm wavelength. b Binding analy- sis of fractions. Fractions 2 (red) and 3 (blue) show significant binding to GC-rich DNA. c Fraction 3 (blue) shows one major component identified as echinomycin (8). d Purified echinomycin (8) binding to GC- rich and AT-rich DNA at 0.09, 0.37, 1.50, 3.00, 5.00, 7.00, and 10.00 Î¼M
