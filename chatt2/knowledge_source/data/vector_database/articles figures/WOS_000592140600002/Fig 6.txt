Fig. 7 Binding-guided isolation of chartreusin (10). a HPLC chromatogram of fractions from extract K14/2 at 254-nm wave- length. b Binding analysis of fractions. Fraction 5 (green) showed binding to GC-rich DNA only. c Fraction 5 (green) shows one major component identified as chartreusin (10). d Purified chartreusin (10) binding to GC and AT-rich DNA at 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 Î¼M
