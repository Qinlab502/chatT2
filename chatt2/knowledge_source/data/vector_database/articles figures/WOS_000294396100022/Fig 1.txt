Fig. 1. Priming mechanism of OTC and ADOTC biosynthesis in S. rimosus. OxyD is involved in the amidation of malonyl-CoA or leading to the synthesis of a malonamate-containing starter unit. The amide of the malonamate primer is malonyl-ACP, incorporated into OTC as the C-2 amide. When acetate is used as the starter unit, the biosynthetic pathway produces ADOTC as a shunt product. OxyP works as a thiolase that eliminates the acetyl-ACP starter units to eliminate ADOTC biosynthesis. Alternatively, acetoacetate could be used to initiate the synthesis of ADOTC followed by eight iterative condensation reactions (Fu et al., 1994).
