Fig. 1   RslO4 Crystal structure:  a Subunit A of RslO4 monoox- ygenase with the secondary  structure elements labelled. The  monomer contains three α heli- ces (α1-α3) and four β strands  (β1- β4) with a ferredoxin fold.  The dimeric apo-form of RslO4  is shown from the side (b) and  top view (c). The two subunits  are coloured in green and blue,  respectively. (d) Electrostatic  potential surface shows a posi- tively charged substrate binding  pocket (SBP)
