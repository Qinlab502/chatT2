Fig. 5   RslO1 crystal structure:  a Stereo view of apo-form  monooxygenase RslO1 struc- ture. The two monomers form  a tight homodimer. b In subunit  A, the substrate binding site  was occupied by a polyethylene  glycol (PEG) molecule derived  from the crystallization condi- tion. c Electrostatic potential  surface shows positively  charged substrate binding  pocket (SBP)
