Fig. 6   Flow  chart  of  methods  and  results  obtained  in  this  study:  a  Based  on  sequence  comparison  RslC1  is  responsible  for  the  enzy- matic  first  ring  cyclization/aromatization  in  rishirilide  biosynthesis  and  b  RslC2  is  responsible  for  the  enzymatic  second  ring  cycliza- tion/aromatization in rishirilide biosynthesis. c Knockout of 3rd ring  cyclase gene “rslC3” using CRISPR-Cas9 system resulted in the pro-
