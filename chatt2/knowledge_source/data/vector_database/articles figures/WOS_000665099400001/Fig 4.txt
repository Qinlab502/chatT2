Fig. 8. Biosynthetic gene cluster of detoxin in S. mobarensis NRRL  B-3729 and N. terpenica IFM 0406 and proof of production of de- toxins by N. terpenica IFM 0406. LC/MS-extracted-ion chromato- grams for the pseudomolecular masses of detoxin D1 (a) and de- toxin D3 (b), respectively. From accurate mass measurements, the  sum formulae C28H42N3O8 (measured m/z 548.2964 [M + H]+, D  0.5 ppm) and C26H40N3O6 (measured m/z 490.2905 [M + H]+, D
