Figure 3. HCT116 cells were treated with 2 μM of test compound [himalaquinone G (7), saquayamycins A (8), B (9), J (14), or K (15), or landomycins A (18), X (23), or Y (29)] or DMSO (negative control) for 6 h followed by Western blot analysis for the indicated proteins. The position of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (p-4E-BP1) is indicated in parentheses, cleaved PARP is included as an apoptotic marker, and β-actin serves as an internal standard reference. For line cytotoxicities (IC50s), see Supporting Information, cancer cell Table S1. For the chemical structures of compounds 1−31, see Chart 1 and Figure 5.
