Fig. 2 | Binding site of TcmX on the bacterial and human ribosomes. a, Transverse section of the cryo-EM map of the 70S ribosome (30S, yellow; 50S,  gray) showing the TcmX (blue) binding site within the large subunit. b, Electron density for TcmX with putative Mg ions (green). c,d, TcmX interactions on  the E. coli ribosome. e, Transverse section of the cryo-EM map of the human 80S ribosome (40S, yellow; 60S, gray) with TcmX (blue). f, Electron density  for TcmX, Mg1 and Mg2 on the human 80S ribosome. g, Interaction of TcmX with the human 80S ribosome. h, Comparison of TcmX binding site on E. coli  (Eco, gray) and H. sapiens (Hsa, wheat) aligned on the basis of the large subunit rRNA nucleotides, E. coli numbering is used.
