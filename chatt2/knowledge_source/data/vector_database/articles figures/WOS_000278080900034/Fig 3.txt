Figure 3. (a) 1H-1H COSY correlations and key long-range 1H-13C HMBC correlations used to establish the structures of utahmycins A (1) and B (2) are shown. (b) The structure of 1 was conÔ¨Årmed by X-ray crystallography (CCDC 734992). A computer- generated perspective drawing of 1 is shown (gray ) carbon, red ) oxygen, blue ) nitrogen). Hydrogen atoms are not shown.
