Figure 4. (a) The two halves of erdacin are predicted to arise from a common octaketide precursor that loses three carbons. Utahmycins A (1) and B (2) likely arise from the incorporation of nitrogen into two different erdacin intermediates. (b) While previous 2-azaan- thraquiones appear to arise from the fungal (F)-type folding of a septaketide, utahmycins A and B appear to arise from a Strepto- myces (S)-type folding of an octaketide.
