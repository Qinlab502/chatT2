Fig. 2 a Pictures of the 4-day-old D. vinaceum cultures grown in Erlenmeyer flasks in the absence and presence of 50 μM BDM44661 (transferred to 15 mL tubes for picture). The picture clearly shows the impact of BDM44661 on the production of the wine red pigment by D. vinaceum while still allowing for bacterial growth. b MA plots show- ing differential gene expression analysis of D. vinaceum transcription following exposure to 50 μM of BDM44661 (M, average gene expres- sion [1/2(log2(BDM) + log2(DMSO)], A, change in gene expression [log2(BDM44661) - log2(DMSO)]). Differentially expressed genes are colour coded according to Z-score (<2 = light grey, 2> = dark grey and
