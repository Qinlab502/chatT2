Figure 2. Mass spectral identiﬁcation of peaks C–E as granatomycin D, granaticin, and dihydrogranaticin B, respectively. (A) Peak C eluted at retention time (tR) 11.4 min, with [M + H]+ of 447.2, consistent with a molecular formula of C22H23O10, conﬁrming production of granatomycin D (446.4 g/mol); (B) Peak D eluted at tR 13.2 min, with [M + H]+ of 445.2, consistent with a molecular formula of C22H21O10, conﬁrming production of granaticin (444.4 g/mol); (C) Peak E eluted at tR 17.0 min, with [M + Na]+ of 583.1, consistent with a molecular formula of C28H32O12Na, conﬁrming production of dihydrogranaticin B (560.5 g/mol).
