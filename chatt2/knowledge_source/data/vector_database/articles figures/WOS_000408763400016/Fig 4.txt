Figure 4. Utilization of molecular networks to identify naphthoquinone derivatives from extracts of Streptomyces sp. PTY087I2 monoculture (red), PTY087I2 co-cultured with MRSA (yellow), and PTY087I2 co-cultured with MSSA (blue). Highlighted area includes nodes for granatomycin D, granaticin, and dihydrogranaticin B, as well as indicating presence of several derivatives of these compounds in one or more extracts.
