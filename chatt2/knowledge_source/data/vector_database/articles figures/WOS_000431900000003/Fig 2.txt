Fig. 2  Intracellular accumulation of Pr-CoA and AN-CoA in S. cerevisiae strains expressing the ssfENKJ genes. a Graphical representation of the  pathway starting with propionic acid feeding. b Pr-CoA accumulation in strains expressing ssfENKJ, and ssfENKJ together with prpE, shown as fold  change compared to the respective control strains. Engineered strains were incubated in selective SC medium either non supplemented (“non  fed”) or supplemented with 0.5 g/L propionic acid (“ ANG4 (prpE  or supplied unbuffered (green bars). Circles indicate  OD600 at 72 h of growth. Represented are the averages and standard deviations of three  independent cultures
