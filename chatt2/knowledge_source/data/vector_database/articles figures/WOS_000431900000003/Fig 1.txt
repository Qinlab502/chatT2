Fig. 1  Bacterial biosynthetic pathway from MM-CoA to AN-CoA. MM-CoA—methylmalonyl-CoA; Ac-CoA—acetyl-CoA; MAA-CoA— 2-methyl-acetoacetyl-CoA; HMB-CoA—3-hydroxyl-2-methyl-butyryl-CoA; AN-CoA—angelyl-CoA; KAS III—beta-ketoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein)  synthase III; 3-ketoacyl-ACP-reductase—3-ketoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) reductase
