Fig. 4  Intracellular accumulation of Pr-CoA, MM-CoA, HMB-CoA, AN-CoA in strains expressing parts of the AN-CoA pathway. MAA-CoA could  not be found in any of the strains. Pr-CoA (purple bars), MM-CoA (yellow bars), HMB-CoA (red bars) and AN-CoA (green bars) in strains expressing  prpE (ANG9), prpE   ssfE/ssfN/ssfK/ssfJ (ANG4). Engineered strains were  incubated for 12 h in selective SC medium buffered to pH 4.5 and supplemented with 0.5 g/L propionic acid. Represented are the averages and  standard deviations of three independent cultures
