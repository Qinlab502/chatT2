Fig. 3  Time course of production of AN-CoA, Ac-CoA and Pr-CoA. a  Ac-CoA and AN-CoA produced by strain expressing prpE  (ANG4). b Ac-CoA and AN-CoA produced by strain expressing  prpE   pccB/accA1  in strains expressing prpE  prpE   pccB/accA1  supplemented with 0.5 g/L propionic acid and buffered to pH 4.5.  Filled circles in a, b indicate  OD600. Represented are the averages and  standard deviations of three independent cultures
