Fig. 6  AN-CoA production in strains expressing plant acyl-CoA  ligases and fed with angelic acid. a Angelate enters the cell and is  converted to angelyl-CoA by carboxyl CoA ligases. b Relative amount  of AN-CoA accumulating in yeast strains expressing CoA-ligases  HlCCL4 (ANG14), StCCL (ANG15), EpCCL1 (ANG16), EpCCL2 (ANG17),  and EpCCL3 (ANG18). Strains were cultured in selective SC medium  supplemented with 0.1 g/L angelic acid. c Time course of production  of AN-CoA (open squares) and Ac-CoA (open triangles) by the strain  expressing CoA-ligase StCCL (ANG15). The corresponding  OD600  values are represented by filled circles. Engineered strains were  incubated in selective SC medium supplemented with 0.1 g/L angelic  acid (all data: mean
