Figure 5. Fasamycin and formicamycin congeners isolated from de-repressed for cluster mutants Deletion of forJ results in accumulation of all previously identiﬁed congeners from the for BGC in addition to the production of two additional formicamycin congeners (R and S), which exhibit a unique C4 chlorination (highlighted in blue). De-repressing the for BGC by deleting forJ in the S. formicae DforX mutant results in the production of six additional fasamycin congeners (L to Q), which have different chlorination and methylation patterns (highlighted in red) compared with fasamycins C–E produced by the wild-type and S. formicae DforX strains. All these congeners displayed potent antibacterial activity against MRSA.
