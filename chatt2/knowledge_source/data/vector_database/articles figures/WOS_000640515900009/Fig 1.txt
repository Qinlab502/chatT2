Figure 2. Manipulation of BGC-situated regulators affects formicamycin biosynthesis during solid culture Deletion of forJ results in overproduction of formicamycins and accumulation of the fasamycin precursors. Deletion of forGF abolishes fasamycin and for- micamycin production. Deletion of forJ combined with a second copy of forGF results in 10-fold higher formicamycin production than the wild-type strain. Deletion of forJ can also be combined with mutations in biosynthetic machinery to generate strains that accumulate precursors and intermediates. Deletion of forZ results in a reduction of formicamycin biosynthesis to around 60% of the wild-type strain on solid agar. Manipulation of forJ is enough to overcome any other regulatory mutation. Error bars represent SD across experimental replicates. Values are mean Â± SD; Wild-type, n = 16; mutants, n = 3.
