Figure 5. Accumulation of cells at the G0–G1 phase of the cell cycle or apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cells. (A) Increasing CosC concentration slowed cell cycle progression in the G0–G1 phase and increased apoptosis of MDA-MB-468 cells. Cells were harvested, ﬁxed, and stained with propidium iodide. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed using FACScalibur Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson). The cell lines were treated with CosC at the indicated concentration for 24 h. The cells were harvested and analyzed. (B) MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with CosC for 24 h. Whole-cell extracts were prepared, separated on SDS–PAGE, and subjected to western blotting with the anti-caspase-3 antibody. Whole-cell extracts were subjected to western blotting with the anti-PARP antibody. The same blots were stripped and probed with b-actin antibody to show equal protein loading.
