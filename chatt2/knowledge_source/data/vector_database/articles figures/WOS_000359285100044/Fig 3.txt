Fig. 4. Mechanistic proposal for the reactions catalyzed by DnrK and RdmB. Both DnrK and RdmB are postulated to catalyze the decarboxylation of 15 as a first step. In DnrK, the open active site would allow protonation of the resulting carbanion by solvent molecules and 4-O-methylation to generate 10. In contrast, RdmB stabilizes the carbanion and catalyzes the formation of an O2â€“anthracycline caged radical pair in the closed active site. Consequent for- mation of a peroxyl intermediate and subsequent reduction of the peroxide by intracellular thiols possibly outside the active site of the enzyme yields the 10- hydroxylated product 11. The reaction sequence leading to the double-prod- uct 12 is only possible if the RdmB reaction happens first. R1, L-rhodosamine.
