Fig. 1. Similar structures, distinct functions. The structures and reactions catalyzed by (A) DnrK and (B) RdmB. In the overall structures, the N-terminal di- merization, the middle, and the catalytic domains are shown in yellow, green, and red, respectively. In the Inset, the catalytic domains are color coded based on dissimilar (black), similar (gray), and identical (white) residues. SAH and the ligands are shown in red, whereas the three regions selected for chimera- genesis (R1, R2, and R3) are shown in orange. The R3 region of RdmB is disordered in the crystal structure and is shown as a dashed orange line in the Inset. In the reaction scheme, “R” represents a thiol reducing agent such as DTT or glutathione.
