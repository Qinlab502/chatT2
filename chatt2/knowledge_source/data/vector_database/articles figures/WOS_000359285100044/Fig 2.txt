Fig. 2. Relative activities of native and engineered enzymes in a coupled re- action with RdmC. The reactions with 8 lead to the accumulation of three products (A–C), whereas in the case of 9 only one product was observed (D). The columns present the formation of (A) 4-O-methyl-15-decarboxyaclacinomycin T (10), (B) 11-deoxy-β-rhodomycin T (11), (C) 4-O-methyl-11-deoxy-β-rhodomycin T (12), and (D) 11-deoxy-β-rhodomycin A (6) by the enzymes. The overall per- centages may not add up to 100% in all samples because some unreacted substrate 15 was left with chimeras harboring poor activity (e.g., DnrK R2 + R3). The excess substrate was converted to the corresponding 10-decarboxylated compounds by exposure to light (overall conversion of 8 to 13 and 9 to 14; Fig. S2) to facilitate the HPLC analyses.
