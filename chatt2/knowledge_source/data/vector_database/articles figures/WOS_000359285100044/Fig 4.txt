Fig. 5. A phylogenetic tree of eight putative SAM-dependent methyl- transferases residing in anthracycline biosynthesis gene clusters and multiple sequence alignment of the R1 area. Amino acids marked with an arrow in the blue column are predicted to be situated at the critical position near C-10 of the anthracycline ligands. Further details regarding these unknown gene clusters and their accession numbers are shown in Fig. S5.
