Figure 5. Qualitative time course of acetyl- and benzoyl-EncC incubated with EncL at room temperature. Shown are the deconvoluted LTQ-orbitrap mass spectra of the reaction mixture before the addition of EncL (â€“EncL) and at the indicated times after the addition of EncL. Indicated in Da are the theoretical (Calc) and experimentally observed (Obs) monoisotopic masses of holo-EncC, acetyl-EncC, and benzoyl-EncC. The acetyl-loaded form of EncC was depleted already 30 seconds after the addition of EncL with a corresponding increase of holo-EncC. In contrast, benzoyl-EncC is hydrolyzed relatively slowly. The concentration of each acyl-EncC form was (cid:2)20 lM, while the concentration of EncL was (cid:2)0.5 lM. Some amount of apo-EncC (calculated mass: 12086.3 Da, observed 12086.1 Da) was clearly visible (vertical arrow) in the control sample without EncL but not in the other samples, probably because of phosphopanteteinylation of apo-EncC by Sfp with residual acyl-CoA. Masses of other strong bands visible in the spectra are consistent with phosphate adducts (+98 Da), potassium adducts (+38), and oxidized forms (+16) of the main species indicated, as shown by the horizontal arrows.
