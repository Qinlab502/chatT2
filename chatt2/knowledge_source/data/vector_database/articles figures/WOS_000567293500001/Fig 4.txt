Figure 4. Characterization of apoptosis induced by marine-derived compounds with and without TRAIL in Jurkat and HCT116 cells. (A,B) Cells were treated with 50 µM of the indicated compounds for 6 h in the absence and in the presence of TRAIL (250 ng) and stained with the ﬂuorescent DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33342. Morphological changes (A,B) were detected under ﬂuorescent microscope using a blue ﬁlter. Corresponding quantiﬁcations are shown in (C,D). All values are presented here as ±SD (n = 3). Signiﬁcance was evaluated by two-way ANOVA. **** p < 0.0001.
