Figure 6. Western blot analysis of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins in HCT116 cells stimulated with TRAIL or marine compounds. (A) Cells were treated with the identiﬁed compounds (50 µM) or TRAIL (0.25 µg/mL) for 24 h. Following incubation, cell lysates were prepared and loaded on SDS-PAGE (12%) and the indicated proteins were detected by immunoblotting. GAPDH or HSC70 were used as loading controls. (B) Cells were pre-incubated for 30 min in the presence or absence of the pan-caspase inhibitor QvD (10 µM) then treated as above with marine compounds (50 µM) or TRAIL (0.25 and 1 µg/mL) for 24 h. Cell lysates were prepared as described above and analyzed for Lamin A/C cleavage by immunoblot.
