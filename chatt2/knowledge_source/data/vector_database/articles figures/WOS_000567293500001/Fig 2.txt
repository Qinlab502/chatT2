Figure 2. Eï¬€ect of marine compounds on the viability of HCT116 and MDA-MB-231 cells. (A,B) The human colorectal and breast cancer cell lines were treated with various concentrations of the marine compounds for 24 h and viability was determined by methylene blue assay. Results correspond to three independent experiments. Error bars represent the SD values. (1) Sharkquinone, (2) resistomycin, (3) undecylprodigiosin, (4) butylcycloheptylprodigiosin, (5) elloxazinone A, (6) elloxazinone B, (7) carboxyexfoliazone, and (8) exfoliazone.
