Figure 5. Western blot analysis of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins in cancer cells treated with marine compounds alone or combined with TRAIL. (A) Jurkat and (B) HCT116 cells were treated or not with marine-derived compounds (50 µM) in the presence or absence of TRAIL (250 ng/mL). Following incubation, cell lysates were prepared and loaded on SDS-PAGE (12%) and the indicated proteins were detected by immunoblotting. (C) MDA-MB-231 cells were stimulated as above and apoptosis-induced by marine-derived compounds in the presence or absence of TRAIL was analyzed by Hoechst staining. All values are presented here as ±SD (n = 3). Signiﬁcance was evaluated by two-way ANOVA. * p < 0.05 and **** p < 0.0001. (D) Corresponding MDA-MB-231 cell lysates were prepared, loaded on SDS-PAGE (12%) and relevant proteins were detected by immunoblot. In all cases, HSC70 was used as a loading control.
