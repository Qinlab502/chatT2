Figure 4. 13C-13C couplings (or in some cases the absence of coupling) observed in 13C (a) and 2D INADEQUATE (b) NMR spectra of [1,2-13C]acetate-labeled erdacin suggest that two distinct polyketide cyclization patterns are used in the biosynthesis of erdacin. Coupling between weak or overlapping NMR signals not clearly seen by 2D INADEQUATE were inferred based on polyketide biosynthetic prece- dent. The exact structure of the late-stage polyketide intermediates used in the biosynthesis of erdacin is not known.
