Figure 5. Thiomarinol binds MRSA COL IleRS with high aﬃnity. (A) Representative ITC data of 250 μM IleRS titrated into 30 μM thiomarinol A (ThioA) at 25 °C. The titration curve depicts an exothermic 1:1 binding event. (B) Representative thermal shift assay of 2.5 μM IleRS in the presence of 5 μM of each antibiotic. The CD signal, ellipticity (mdeg), of IleRS at 210 nm was measured as a function of temperature to determine ’s in the presence of each antibiotic obtained from thermal shift assay, enthalpies of binding the melting temperatures (Tm at 25 °C, pH 7.4 (ΔH°′) obtained from ITC, and calculated dissociation constants (Kd,25 °C).
