Figure 1. Structures of the antibiotics discussed in the study. Thiomarinol A is a hybrid of a dithiolopyrrolone (DTP, red) and marinolic acid, a pseudomonic acid derivative. Pseudomonic acids A, B, and C are components of the drug mupirocin. Pseudomonyl C holothinamide (PAC-holo) is a synthetic analogue of thiomarinol A. Thiomarinol, holothin, holomycin, and thiolutin are all DTP natural products.
