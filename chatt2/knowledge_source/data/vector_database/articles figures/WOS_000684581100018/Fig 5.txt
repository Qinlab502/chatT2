Figure 3. Chemical−gene interactions of PAC-holo correlate with mupirocin. A heat map of the Pearson correlation coeﬃcients (r) between chemical treatments of the CRISPRi library in B. subtilis is shown. Higher correlation (r) of chemical−gene scores between antibiotics indicates more similar chemical−gene interactions. The range of r values is depicted with a color scale from yellow (high) to indigo (low). Self-correlations, which always have an r of 1, are shown in white, while an r of 0 denotes no correlation. Dendrograms at the top and left side of the ﬁgure show the relationship between compounds, with shorter branches indicating more similarity in chemical−gene interactions. Compounds investigated in this study are in bold.
