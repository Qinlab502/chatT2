Figure 2. Hybrid antibiotic PAC-holo targets IleRS in B. subtilis and exerts distinctive eﬀect from mupirocin. The knockdown of ileS is most sensitized in the library to treatment with (A) mupirocin or (B) PAC-holo. Genes in the top and bottom 2.5% outliers of the chemical−gene score (y-axis) are labeled with their gene name (ileS in red, genes involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis in blue, and genes involved in cell shape regulation in yellow). Gene order (x-axis) corresponds to the order the genes appear in the genome of B. subtilis.
