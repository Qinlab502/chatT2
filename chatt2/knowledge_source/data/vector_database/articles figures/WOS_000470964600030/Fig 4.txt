Figure 4. Saquayamycin B (9) treatment dose-dependently inhibited invasion and migration in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Cell invasion and migration were observed with incubation for 12 h by Transwell and wound-healing assays. A: cresyl violet staining in the Transwell assay, captured by a microscope (100× magnification). B: quantification by counting the number of cells in the Transwell assay. C: effects of wound-healing captured by a microscope (100× magnification). D: analysis of the wound- healing rate. Results are presented as mean ± SD. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 compared to the control group.
