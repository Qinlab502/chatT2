Figure 7. Quaternary structure in the SnoaL family. (a) SnoaL2 dimer (cyan) superimposed on the Aâ€“B dimer from the SnoaL tetramer (magenta). (b) SnoaL2 dimer (cyan) superimposed on the dimer of limonene 1,2-epoxide hydrolase (magenta). In all cases, the SnoaL and epoxide hydrolase dimers are viewed after superposition of their A subunit onto the A subunit of SnoaL2.
