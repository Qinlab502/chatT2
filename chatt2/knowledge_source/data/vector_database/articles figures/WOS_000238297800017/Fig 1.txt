Figure 1. (a) Structure of nogalamycin. (b) 1-Hydroxylated aklavinone produced in vivo as a consequence of expressing the snoaL2 and aclR genes in the aklavinone-producing S. galilaeus mutant H039. (c) crude extracts (in toluene) of S. galilaeus mutant H039 (left) and H039/pEHA. Mutant H039 produces yellow aklavinone (left), and the transformant containing the AclR gene produces orange 1-hydroxyaklavinone (right).
