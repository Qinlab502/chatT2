Figure 3. Structure of SnoaL2. (a) Structure of the SnoaL2 dimer. The secondary structure elements in subunit A are colored differently, helices cyan and b-strands magenta. The part of helix H5 in subunit A that is from the C-terminal linker/tag peptide is shown in dark blue. The secondary structural elements and the termini are labeled. Subunit B of the dimer is shown in green. (b) Superposition of the two chains of SnoaL2. Chain A is shown in cyan (the C-terminal linker/ tag helix is colored dark blue) and chain B in magenta. The orientation of the monomers is the same as for chain A in (a). CA and CB indicate the C termini of chain A and B, respectively. (c) Experimental MAD electron density after solvent ﬂattening and the ﬁnal model for the C termini of chain A and B, respectively. The chains are colored as in (b) and the corresponding maps are shown in blue for chain A and red for chain B. The maps are contoured at 1.5s. The models and maps are superimposed according to the NCS.
