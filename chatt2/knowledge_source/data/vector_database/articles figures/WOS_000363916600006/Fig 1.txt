Figure 1. Structural elucidation of fossil boron-containing organic pigments (borolithochromes) isolated from the Jurassic putative red alga Solenopora jurassica and comparison with the present-day aromatic polyketide clostrubin from the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium beijerinckii. (A) Slab of S. jurassica with exceptional preservation of borolithochromes (SMNS P24204), Upper Jurassic, France. Scale bar, 1 cm. (B) 1.7 mm NMR tube with 38 μg of borolithochrome C1 (3a) dissolved in 40 μL of DMSO-d6. (C) 1H NMR (upper) and HMBC spectrum (lower) of borolithochrome H1 (2a) (800 MHz, DMSO-d6) showing 1H−13C long-range correlations. (D) Chemical structures of the borolithochromes showing the exceptional benzo[gh]tetraphene scaﬀold. 1, 4, and 6 are racemates [racemic mixture of (M)- and (P)-enantiomer]; 2a/2b and 5a/5b are (M,14′S)/(P,14′S) conﬁgured diastereomers; 3a/3b and 9a/9b are (M,14S,14′S)/(P,14S,14′S) conﬁgured diastereomers. From the borolithochromes 7 and 8, only the (M,14′S) and (P,14S,14′S) conﬁgured diastereomers, respectively, could be isolated in suﬃcient purity for NMR spectroscopic assignment. (M) and (P) denote the conﬁguration of the chiral axis of the borate. (E) Chemical structure of clostrubin A.
