Figure 12. Structural alignment of THCA synthase crystal structure with homology models of CBDA and CBCA synthase showing amino acid differences in the active site. THCA synthase active site amino acid residues are shown in green, CBDA synthase residues shown in cyan and CBCA synthase residues shown in orange. CBGA ligand (shown in yellow) was docked into the THCA synthase active site while the FAD molecule is colored purple.
