Figure 4. Proposed OAC cyclization mechanism to form OLA. (A) Extraction of proton by His78 from C2 of substrate. (B,C) C2 to C7 aldol condensation facilitated by reabsorption of proton from His78 by carbonyl O on C7. (D,E) Aromatization, release of CoA thioester and subsequent release of OLA product.
