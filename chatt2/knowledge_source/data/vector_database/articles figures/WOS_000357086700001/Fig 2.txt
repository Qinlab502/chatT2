Fig. 2 TDPN effects on migration and proliferation of HaCaT cell line. Migration of HaCaT cells were measured by scratch wound assay and ECIS system. Scratch wound healing assay of HaCaT cells treated with different concentrations of TDPN for 24 h. Cells were seeded with density 3 × 104 cells/ml 24 h before scratch and treated. Distance of the scratch was measured after 24 h treated with TDPN (a). Cells were subjected to ECIS migration assay in the absence or the presence of TDPN or TGF-β as indicated. Cells were allowed to grow to confluence and initial resistance was measured for few hours. Cells were subjected to high voltage to initiate wound at 3 h resulting in the drop of resistance. Remaining cells were allowed to migrate in the presence or absence of TDPN and resistance changes were measured for 24 h after the creation of wound (b). Represented pictures are shown from 3 independent experiments. Invasion of TDPN treated cells were measured using transwell chambers as described in methods (c). Proliferation of keratinocyte cells were measures three different methods; MTT assay, Hoechst staining, and trypan blue counting assays (d). Cells were seeded for 24 h, then treated with various concentrations of TDPN or DMSO for 24 h. After treatment, cells were collected and counted in Trypan blue assay or incubated with Hoechst 33342 or MTT reagent. Results were measured by flourescence spectrometer or spectrometer. Western blot of cell cycle-related proteins comparing cells treated with 10 μM TDPN and untreated cells. Protein lysate from cells treated with TDPN for 24 h were taken using RIPA buffer. The expression level was measured by comparing the density of the target protein to GAPDH (e). (*)P < 0.05 compare to control group
