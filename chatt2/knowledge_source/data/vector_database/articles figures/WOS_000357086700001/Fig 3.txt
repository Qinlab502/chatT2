Fig. 3 ERK and AKT phosphorylation is involved in promotion of keratinocyte migration by TDPN. HaCaT cells were treated with either DMSO or 10 μM TDPN for the indicated time (a) or the indicated dose for 2 h (b) and harvested for western blot analysis. Band intensity is presented as mean ± SE of relative to GAPDH and ratio between pAKT or pERK of TDPN and pAKT or pERK of control DMSO treatment from least 3 replications. (*)P < 0.05 compare to control group) (c) Cells were pre-treated with PI3K inhibitor (LY49002, 50 μM,) or MEK inhibitor (pd98059, 50 μM,) for 24 h, then treated with TDPN for 1 h and harvested for western blot analysis, to assess the involvement of the ERK and AKT signaling pathways. (d) After co-treatment of TDPN and PI3K inhibitor (LY49002, 50 μM) or MEK inhibitor (pd98059, 50 μM) for 24 h, scratch wound healing assay were performed. Distance of the scratch was measured relative to control after 24 h of treatment with TDPN. (*)P < 0.05)
