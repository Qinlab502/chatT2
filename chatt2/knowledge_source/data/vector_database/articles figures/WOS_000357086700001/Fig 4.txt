Fig. 4 TDPN induces EMT like change. HaCaT cells were treated with TDPN (10 μM) for the indicated time (a) or at the indicated dose (b) and harvested for western blot analysis. (data presented as mean of relative to GAPDH ± SE from least 3 replications, (*)P < 0.05 compare to control group). (c) HaCaT cells treated with 10 μM TDPN for 24 h. After treatment, the conditioned media from the cells was concentrated using amicon centrifugation. Protein in media was collected and analysed by western blot for Collagen I, Collagen III, Fibronectin, and MMP1. (d)Transcriptional expression of MMPs in HaCaT cells treated with TDPN (10 μM for 24 h). After treatment, total RNA from each cells was taken by Trizol reagent and analysed by RT-PCR for MMP1, MMP2, MMP7. GAPDH was used as a control. (data presented as mean of relative to GAPDH ± SE from least 3 replications, (*)P < 0.05 compare to control group)
