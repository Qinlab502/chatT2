Figure 1. Genetic organisation of the polyketomycin biosynthetic gene cluster. Genes of the minimal PKSII system are highlighted in black, and genes encod- ing PKSII-derived polyketide modifying enzymes are checked. Genes that are involved in 3,6-DMSA synthesis are labelled in light grey and genes that are re- sponsible for the dioxysugar biosynthesis and glycosyltransfer are striped. Genes that are putatively involved in providing essential precursors or regulation and resistance are displayed in dark grey. Genes that are most probably not involved in polyketomycin biosynthesis are shown in white.
