Figure 3. Maximum-likelihood tree showing the phylogenetic positions of ﬁve carbendazim-resistant strains (4, 14, 36, 78, and 98) and ﬁve carbendazim-sensitive strains (7, 17, 19, 22, and 27) and related taxa on the basis of the concatenated sequences of TEF1-α and RPB2. The numbers on the branches are conﬁdence limits (expressed as percentages) estimated from a bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates. The bar represents 0.01 substitution per nucleotide position.
