Fig. 7   Anti-metastatic  activity  by  in  vitro  wound  scratch  assay.  Cell  migration  of  tumor  cells  (HeLa)  in  presence  and  absence  of  aro- matic polyketides was compared. Analysis of cell migration was done  by  using  T  Scratch  analysis  software.  Confluent  cell  cultures  were  scratched  and  immediately  imaged  at  ×5  magnification  (0  h).  HeLa  cells were incubated in medium alone (24 h untreated control) or aro-
