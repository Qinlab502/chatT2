Fig. 3 Biosynthetic gene cluster and proposed biosynthetic pathway of TXN-A and relative metabolites. (A) Localization of the cloned DNA region as represented by three overlapping fosmids and organization of the txn gene cluster. Color coding indicates the genes for the PKS and PKS associated enzymes (pink), tailoring enzymes (red), deoxysugar (blue), regulators and resistant proteins (green), and all others (black). (B) Proposed model for type II PKS and post-PKS modiﬁcation. (C) Proposed biosynthetic pathway of two deoxysugar moieties. The signiﬁcant points of the pathway were highlighted by colored circles.
