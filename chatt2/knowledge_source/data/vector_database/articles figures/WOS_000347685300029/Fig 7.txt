Fig. 8 a, b High-resolution S1 nuclease mapping of the TSP for the sagAp and sagRp promoters in S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 wild- type (WT) and S. aureofaciens aur1R-disrupted (Î”aur1R) strains. RNA was isolated from cultures grown in liquid Bennet medium to the time points indicated, which corresponded to the different growth phases (Fig. 2a). E. coli tRNA was used as a control (lane C). c Control S1 nuclease mapping experiment with the same RNA samples and a DNA probe for the hrdBp2 promoter (Kormanec and Farkasovsky 1993). The RNA- protected DNA fragments were analysed on DNA sequencing gels together with G+A (lane A) and T+C (lane T) sequencing ladders derived from the end- labelled fragments (Maxam and Gilbert 1980). All S1 nuclease mapping experiments were performed two times with independent sets of RNA, giving similar results
