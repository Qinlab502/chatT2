Fig. 2 a Growth curve of S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 wild- type (WT) strain in liquid Bennet medium. Time points used for the TLC analysis of auricin production and transcriptional analysis are indicated by arrows. b Analysis of auricin production in the wild-type and sagR mutant by biochromatography. Ethyl acetate extracts from both strains grown in Bennet medium to the time points indicated were resolved by TLC and overlaid with B. subtilis as described in the “Materials and methods”. The arrow indicates the inhibition zone corresponding to auricin (Kutas et al. 2013). c HPLC analysis of auricin production by the S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 wild-type (WT), sagA- and sagR- disrupted strains (ΔsagA, ΔsagR) grown for 14 h in Bennet medium. The control run of 3 μg of purified auricin is included
