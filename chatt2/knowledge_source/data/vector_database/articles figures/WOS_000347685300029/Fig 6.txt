Fig. 7 A comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the sagAp and sagRp promoters protected by Aur1R with the previously characterised Aur1R-binding sites in the aur1Pp, aur1Rp and aur1PR3p promoters (Novakova et al. 2010, 2011) and the autoregulatory element (ARE) consensus sequence of the Streptomyces GBL autoregulator receptor proteins (Folcher et al. 2001). Identical residues are highlighted in black.
