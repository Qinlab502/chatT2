Fig. 3 a, b High-resolution S1 nuclease mapping of the TSP for the sagAp and sagRp promoters in the S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 wild-type (WT), S. aureofaciens sagA-disrupted (ΔsagA) and S. aureofaciens sagR- disrupted (ΔsagR) strains. The 5′-labelled DNA fragments (Fig. 1) were hybridised with RNA isolated from cultures grown in liquid Bennet medium to the time points indicated, which corresponded to the different growth phases (Fig. 2a). E. coli tRNA was used as a control (lane C). c Control S1 nuclease mapping experiment with the same RNA samples and a DNA probe for the hrdBp2 promoter (Kormanec and Farkasovsky 1993). The RNA-protected DNA fragments were analysed on DNA sequencing gels together with G + A (lane A) and T + C (lane T)
