Fig. 5 Binding of SagR to the aur1R–aur1P intergenic region. a Detec- tion of protein–DNA complexes by EMSA using a 0.1 ng 32P-labelled 406-bp DNA fragment (probe 3, Fig. 1) comprising the aur1R–aur1P intergenic region (Novakova et al. 2010) with increasing amounts of purified His-tagged SagR. A labelled DNA fragment in the absence of protein (lane 1); 2, 5, 10 and 10 μg, respectively, of the purified His- tagged SagR protein (lanes 2 to 5). Addition of 200 ng of the unlabelled 406-bp DNA fragment was used to demonstrate SagR-binding specificity (lane 5). b DNase I footprint of SagR binding to 0.4 ng of a 5′ end- labelled 406-bp DNA fragment encompassing the aur1P–aur1R intergenic region. The vertical bar indicates the positions of the SagR- binding sites. The numbering is relative to the TSP of the aur1Pp and aur1Rp promoters. Lane 1 is without the His-tagged sagR protein sample.
