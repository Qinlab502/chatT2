Figure 6. Overview of PP biosynthesis gene phylogenies. (a) Phylogenetic relationships between KSα, KSβ, Baeyer−Villiger oxidase, Asn synthase homologue, geminal bis-methyltransferase and glycosyltransferase genes from PP biosynthetic gene clusters are reconstructed from the maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees to highlight the relationships between genes from clusters of diﬀerent PP lineages. (b) The parent maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees for BVO genes, GBM genes and Asn synthase homologue genes are shown.
