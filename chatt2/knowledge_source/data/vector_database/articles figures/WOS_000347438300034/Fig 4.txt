Figure 5. Diﬀerent PP chemistries are organized according to the phylogenetic analysis of KSβ gene sequences (Figure 1). This analysis reveals four diﬀerent PP scaﬀolds with distinct polyketide chain lengths. We have designated these scaﬀolds PP-A, PP-B, PP-C and PP-D. Each diﬀerent PP scaﬀold and the compounds arising form the scaﬀold are shown in diﬀerent colors. Structures shown in black are hypothetical intermediates. The structures of sugar moieties were not shown due to the limited space.
