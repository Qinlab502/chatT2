Figure 4. Proposed biosynthesis of calixanthomycin A (1), and arenimycins C (2) and D (3) (in boxes) based on the predicted gene function and Pfam domain analysis. The presence of arenimycin B in the culture extract was conﬁrmed by LC−MS. Detailed gene annotation tables for the Clx and Arn gene clusters appear in Tables S3 and S4.
