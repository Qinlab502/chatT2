Figure 1. Mining of soil eDNA for pentangular polyphenols. (a) Phylogeny-guided strategy for the discovery of new natural products. (b) The maximum likelihood5 tree of partial KSβ gene sequences is shown. AZ, AB and TX denote amplicon sequences derived from Arizona, California and Texas desert soil eDNA libraries, respectively. A number of eDNA-derived PP KSβ sequence tags fall between clades associated with PPs derived from polyketide precursors of diﬀerent lengths (C24 and C26). The speciﬁc group of intermediate eDNA sequence tags used in this study are highlighted in orange.
