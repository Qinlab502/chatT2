Fig. 3. Molecular architectures of the active sites of AlnA and AlnB. Stereo views of (A) native AlnA at 2.1-Å resolution (σ = 1.2), (B) AlnA in complex with D-ribose-5-phosphate (yellow) at 3.15-Å resolution (σ = 1.2), (C) native AlnB in the open conformation at 1.25-Å resolution (σ = 2.0), and (D) AlnB in complex with phosphate (orange) at 1.5-Å resolution (σ = 1.5). The ligands were omitted from calculation of the electron density maps (2Fo-Fc) to re- duce model bias. The metal ions Ca2+ (purple) and Mg2+ (yellow) and water molecules (white) are shown as spheres.
