Figure 2. Monitoring of the PgaE Reaction in the Presence of 1, NADPH, and Molecular Oxygen (A) Reaction followed spectrophotometrically at the substrate absorption max- imum of 406 nm. (B) HPLC analysis of extracted reaction products demonstrate that no com- pounds absorb at the Vis range. (C) In the absence of PgaE, the substrate remains intact.
