Figure 5. Model for Gaudimycin C Biosynthesis In the ﬁrst step, PgaE catalyzes hydroxylation of UWM6 at position 12, which is followed by quinone formation. The ﬁrst reaction of PgaM is catalyzed by the SDR domain (PgaMred), resulting in 2,3-dehydration. Finally, the oxygenase domain of PgaM (PgaMox) catalyzes C12b-hydroxylation and C6 ketoreduction by the QM mechanism. This is initiated by enzyme-induced tautomerization of the substrate to form a highly polarized o-QM. The conjugated intermediate is readily hydrated to 5 in an intramolecular redox reaction involving enzyme-stabilized nucleophilic addition of water at C12b and reduction of C6.
