Figure 3. Transcriptional organization of rsl-genes. (a) Genetic organization of the rishirilide gene cluster. Regulatory, biosynthetic, and transporter genes are highlighted in red, grey, and green, respectively. The solid lines under the genes depict transcriptional units, black bent arrows are promoter regions, grey bent arrows are putative promoters; (b) RT-PCR analysis of rsl-genes co-transcription. RNA, genomic DNA (C), and cDNA were used as a template in PCR reactions. The functions of rsl-genes are described in [30,33,35].
