Figure 2. Transcriptional proﬁle of regulatory genes in the wild type strain and in different mutants. (a) sqRT-PCR analysis of rslR1, rslR2, rslR3, rslR4, and hrdB transcripts in S. bottropensis strains. PCR was performed using cDNA and chromosomal DNA (C) as a template. β-glucuronidase activity from a promoterless construct (b), a construct containing the rslR1 promoter (c), a construct containing the rslR2 promoter (d) determined in the wild type strain and in S. bottropensis ∆R1, S. bottropensis ∆R2, and S. bottropensis ∆R3. Cultures and subsequent β-glucuronidase measurements were done in triplicate. Values were normalized to equal amounts of dry biomass. Error bars represent standard deviations. Signiﬁcant differences in β-glucuronidase between the wild type and tested strains were calculated by a two-tailed t-test. Asterisks represent the signiﬁcance value (** p < 0.01), whereas NS refers to not-signiﬁcant differences.
