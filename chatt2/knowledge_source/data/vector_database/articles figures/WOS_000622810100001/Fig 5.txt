Figure 5. RslR4 negatively regulates transcription of rslT4 and rslR4 genes. (a) Transcriptional activity of rslT4 promoter in S. bottropensis and in S. bottropensis ∆R4. (b) Transcriptional activity of rslR4 promoter in S. bottropensis and in S. bottropensis ∆R4. Cultures and subsequent β-glucuronidase measurements were done in triplicate. Values were normalized to equal amounts of dry biomass. Error bars represent standard deviations. Signiﬁcant differences in β-glucuronidase between S. bottropensis and S. bottropensis ∆R4 were calculated by a two-tailed t-test. Asterisks represent the signiﬁcance value (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01), whereas NS refers to not-signiﬁcant differences. (c) Electrophoretic mobility shift assay to study interaction of RslR4 with rslR4-T4 region. Increasing concentrations of RslR4 were mixed with labeled rslR4-T4 DNA probe. (d) Competition assay of RslR4 (100 nM) with rslR4-T4 region carrying 10-, 50-, 100- and 250-fold excess of unlabeled probe.
