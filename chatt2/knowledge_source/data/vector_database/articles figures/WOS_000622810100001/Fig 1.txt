Figure 1. Rishirilides production by S. bottropensis strains. (a) UHPLC-MS analysis of culture extracts from S. bottropensis (WT) and mutant strains (S. bottropensis ∆R1, ∆R2, ∆R3, and ∆R4); (b) UHPLC-MS analysis of culture extracts from complemented rslR1, rslR2 and (c) rslR3 mutant strains. Strains carrying the empty vector pSET152 or pTES were used as a control. (d) Levels of total rishirilide (RSH) production by the wild type and strains which overexpress regulatory genes. The mean value of total rishirilide production in S. bottropensis (WT) and S. bottropensis pUWLH (WT pUWLH) was taken as 100%. Error bars represent standard deviations. Signiﬁcant differences in total rishirilide production between S. bottropensis and strains overexpressing regulatory genes were calculated by a two-tailed t-test. Asterisks represent the signiﬁcance value (** p < 0.01), whereas NS refers to not-signiﬁcant differences.
