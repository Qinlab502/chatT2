Figure 4. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay to study binding of RslR3DBD to promoter region of rslR1, rslR2, and structural genes. (a) EMSA containing rslR2p; (b) competition assay of RslR3DBD (1 ÂµM) with rslR2p carrying 10, 100, 250, and 500-fold excess of unlabeled probe; (c) EMSA containing rslR1p; (d) EMSA containing promoters of structural genes.
