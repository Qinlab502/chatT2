Figure 2. Current model of genes and regulatory cascades aﬀected during resistance development against CHD in K. pneumoniae, leading to dysregulation of eﬄux mediated by AcrAB-TolC (pump schematically presented according to structural models [57,58]). In contrast to CHD, CDCHD does not lead to the development of resistant mutants and it is furthermore able to escape elimination through eﬄux (red crosses), hence retaining antimicrobial activity. Bolt-shaped arrows indicate resistance-associated eﬀects either by direct mutation in the case of ramR (black bolt) or change of expression levels of various factors controlling acrAB-tolC expression (grey bolts). Gene products in grey rectangles and green diamonds represent transcriptional repressors and activators, respectively. Green and red triangles (associated with black arrows) represent increasing and decreasing amounts of gene products with direct inﬂuence on AcrAB-TolC production, respectively. The genes or operons aﬀected by CHD-mediated resistance include ram (resistance antibiotic multiple), sox (sulfur-oxidizing operon), mar (multiple antibiotic resistance), lon (encoding a serine protease), and acrAB-tolC (encoding the antibiotic eﬄux pump) [36,41]. OM, outer membrane; IM, inner membrane.
