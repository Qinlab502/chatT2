Fig. 1. Immunolocalization examined by confocal microscopy of Bsep-GFP (WT and mutants) in transfected Can 10 cells cultured at 37(cid:3)C. Bsepwt and BsepA257V were expressed at the canalicular mem- brane, whereas BsepG985R, BsepR1128C, and BsepT1210P were not detected at the canaliculus, but rather in the cytoplasm colocalizing with calreticulin. *Bile canaliculus. Bar: 10 mm.
