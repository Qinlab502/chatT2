Fig. 2. A) HPLC-traces of lysolipin I standard, extracts of S. albus kir-2K05 control strain carrying cosmid 2K05 which contains non-functional parts of the kirromycin gene cluster (Weber et al., 2008) and S. albus carrying cosmid 4H04. Lysolipin I was detected at a retention time (RT) of 12.1 min. B) Positive mode [M+H]+ mas-spectrum of lysolipin I standard and S. albus 4H04 (substance peaks at RT 12.1 min). C) UV/Vis spectra comparison of S. albus 4H04 lysolipin I (solid line) and of lysolipin I standard (dashed line). Anorm: normalized absorption D) UV/Vis spectra comparison of S. albus 4H04 lysolipin I (solid line) and lysolipin I database reference (dashed line).
