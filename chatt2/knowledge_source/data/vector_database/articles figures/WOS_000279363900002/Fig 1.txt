Fig. 1. Hypothetical pathway for lysolipin biosynthesis. (a1) Formation of the polyketide chain from malonamide starter and malonate extenders; (b1) cyclization and reduction of polyketide precursor; alternatively, the incorporation of the amino group might occur at a later stage of biosynthesis (a2, b2); (c, d) Oxidative modiﬁcation and “tailoring” of the intermediate; (e) spontaneous reduction of lysolipin X to lysolipin I and export. *O2 from molecular oxygen; ▲ CH3 from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM); ↔ malonate unit; ➞ acetate unit; A–G: ring nomenclature; 1–29: atoms involved in forming the lysolipin backbone (according to Bockholt et al., 1994).
