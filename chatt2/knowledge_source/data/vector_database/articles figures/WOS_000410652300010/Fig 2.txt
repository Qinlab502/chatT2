Fig. 2   The  bldA  knockout  in  S.  albus  abolished  the  production  of  antibacterial  compound(s),  but  not  antifungal  one(s).  For  the  bioas- say,  agar  plugs  were  cut  off  5-day  lawns  of  S.  albus  strains  grown  on  SG2  agar,  and  stacked  on  top  of  plates  with  test  cultures.  Note  the  small  halos  of  D.  hansenii  growth  inhibition  around  SAM2  and  OK3
