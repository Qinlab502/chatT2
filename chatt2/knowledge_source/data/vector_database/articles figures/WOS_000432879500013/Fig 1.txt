Fig. 5. Experimental (dotted lines) and calculated (solid lines) ECD spectra of (3R, 6S, 6aR, 7R, 12R, 12aS)-1 (panel a) and (6S, 6aR, 7R, 12R, 12aS)-2 (panel b). Calculations level: CAM-B3LYP/def2-TZVP; see text and Supporting Information for details. Calculated spectra plotted as sum of Gaussians with 0.40 eV exponential band-width, shifted by +20 nm, and scaled for better comparison.
