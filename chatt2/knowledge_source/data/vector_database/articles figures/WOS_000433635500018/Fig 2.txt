Figure 1. Organization of (a) streptolydigin BGC from Streptomyces lydicus NRRL 2433; (b) cytorhodin BGC from Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 1666; (c) chemical structures of tirandamycins, streptolydigin, cytorhodins, and their intermediates. *p17C4 represents the cosmid containing all L- rhodinose biosynthesis genes along with the GT-encoding gene slgG and NRPS encoding genes.
