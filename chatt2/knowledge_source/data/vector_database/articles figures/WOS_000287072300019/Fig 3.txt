Figure 3 Proposed FD-594 biosynthetic pathway. A glycosyltransferase, PnxGT2, and a methyltransferase, PnxMT2, in the Ô¨Ånal two steps of the FD-594 biosynthesis were functionally characterized in this study. *Proteins outside of the gene cluster might catalyze reductions. ACP, acyl carrier protein; DH, dehydratase; ER, enoylreductase; KR, ketoreductase; KS, ketosynthase.
