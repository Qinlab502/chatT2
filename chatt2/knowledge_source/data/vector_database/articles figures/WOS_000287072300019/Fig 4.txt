Figure 4 HPLC traces of PnxGT2 and PnxMT2 enzymatic reaction products. LC–ESI–MS analysis was performed using LCQ (Finnigan) coupled with Nanospace HPLC (Shiseido, Yokohama, Japan) with a standard ODS column. The elution was made using 10% CH3CN(aq.) for 10 min, followed by a linear gradient of 40–100% CH3CN(aq.) for 30 min at a ﬂow rate of 50 ml min–1. See details in Supplementary Information. (a) PnxGT2 with aglycon and TDP-olivose; (b) PnxGT2 and PnxMT2 with aglycon, TDP-olivose (c) PnxMT2 with S-adenosyl-L-methionine and S-adenosyl-L-methionine; after inactivation of PnxGT2 in a; (d) a half amount of B plus authentic FD- 594; (e) aglycon and TDP-olivose (no enzyme) as control. The LC traces of LC–ESI–MS analysis are similar to the HPLC-UV traces; the raw data were omitted. Instead, the m/z values of the corresponding peaks in the negative mode ESI–MS analysis are shown in these traces.
