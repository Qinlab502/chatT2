Fig. 1 (A) GT catalyzed glycosyl group transfer with either inversion or retention of the anomeric stereochemistry with respect to the donor sugar (NMP refers to nucleoside mono-phosphate). (B) Classical SN2-like mechanism for inverting glycosylation (R1 can be a sugar, a lipid, a protein residue or a NP).
