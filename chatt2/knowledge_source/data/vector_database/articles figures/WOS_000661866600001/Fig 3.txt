Fig. 4 Molecular representation of the reactant and the highest energy structures for models 1 and 2 obtained at the QM(BP86/6-31G+(d))/MM (CHARMM) level. Ser10 is not part of the QM partition (QM1 fragment). Model 1: (A) reactant structure and (B) highest energy structure; model 2: (C) reactant structure, and (D) highest energy structure. Nucleophilic activation is indicated by pink transparent circles.
