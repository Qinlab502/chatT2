Fig. 5 QM/MM modeling of the inverting glycosylation mechanism catalyzed by O-LanGT2: Michaelis complex or reactant (R), transition state (TS) and product (P) structures. For clarity, the labels of atoms and molecules are only shown in the R panel. In this case, the label Wcat is not shown but the atoms of the water molecule are labeled as OW and HW. The bottom right corner panel corresponds to the energy proÔ¨Åle of the MEP, calculated at the QM(BP86/6-31G(d))/MM(CHARMM) level, shown in blue, and the QM(M06-2X/6-311G(d,p))//QM(BP86/6-31G(d))/MM(CHARMM) level.
