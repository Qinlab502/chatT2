Fig. 2 Representation of the QM/MM systems. (Left) A water sphere of 30 Ã… radius centered at C1 of olivose was used (water molecules are depicted by white balls-and-sticks). The N-terminal (aglycon) and C-terminal (nucleotide-sugar) binding domains are presented by green and light-blue surfaces, respectively; the substrates are shown as yellow licorice at the active site. (Right) Active site view of the models 1 and 2, showing the QM1 layer (with the exception of Ser10) represented as balls-and-sticks (for clarity, only polar hydrogens are represented). Note that the dp abbreviation in dp-olivose refers to diphosphate.
