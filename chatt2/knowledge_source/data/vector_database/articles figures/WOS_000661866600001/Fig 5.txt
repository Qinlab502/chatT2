Fig. 6 Orbital and molecular representation of Lewis-type NBO (donor) and non-Lewis-type NBO (acceptor) interactions. The structures in all panels correspond to the TS, and the estimation of the energetic impor- tance for each interaction was calculated by subtracting the energy con- tribution between the TS and the reactant: (B) ∼18 kcal mol−1, (C) ∼14 kcal mol−1 and (D) ∼38 kcal mol−1. For clarity, atom labels are only shown to highlight the orbital interaction being represented.
