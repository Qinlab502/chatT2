Fig. 3. Neighbour-joining trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences (A) and six-gene concatenated sequences (16S rRNA-atpD-gyrB-recA-rpoB-trpB) (B), showing the relationships between the three strains isolated from violet stains (MCs36, MC05 and MC48) and others Streptomyces species. Bootstrap values (N50%) are expressed as percentages of 1000 replicates. Filled circles indicate nodes that were also recovered by the maximum-likelihood and maximum-parsimony algorithms. The strain Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv was used as outgroup. The scale bars indicate 0.01 and 0.02 substitutions per nucleotide position in 16S rRNA and concatenated gene sequences trees, respectively.
