Fig. 2. FESEM images of the green bioﬁlms and violet stains from the Circular Mausoleum tomb. A. General view of the green bioﬁlm (sample GB1). The mortar substratum is abundantly coated with microbial ﬁlaments. Branching in the left center of the ﬁgure is characteristic of Iphinoe spelaeobios. Scale bar = 30 μm. B. Detailed view of the cyanobacterial ﬁlaments with 2.5 μm diameter. Scale bar = 5 μm. C. Calciﬁed sheath of an Iphinoe ﬁlament. Scale bar = 5 μm. D. Cyanobacterial ﬁlaments associated with actinobacteria mycelia (sample GV2). Scale bar = 5 μm. E and F. General view of the violet stain (sample VS3) depicting abundant aerial hyphae and spores. Scale bar = 10 μm. G. Streptomyces aerial mycelia and arthrospores. Scale bar = 4 μm.
