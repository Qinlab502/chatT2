Figure 4. Biochemical assay of TjhO5 and TjhD4 with NADPH regeneration and D-[1-2H]-glucose. (a) Biochemical reaction of TjhO5/TaGDH using 15 as a substrate can generate 2H-16. (b) Chemical structure of 2H-16 revealed by 2H NMR signals in CH2Cl2: (i) 1H NMR spectrum of 16; (ii) 2H NMR spectrum of 2H-16. (c) The reaction of TjhO5/D4/BmGDH using 15 as a substrate produced 2H-4, 2H-8, and 2H-17.
