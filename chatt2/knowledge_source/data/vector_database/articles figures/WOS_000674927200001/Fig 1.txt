Figure 2. Characterization ofa TjhO5-catalyzed reaction using 15 as a substrate. (a) HPLC analysis of enzymatic reactions with UV detected at 272 nm. The assays were conducted at 30 Â°C for 30 min. (b) Reaction scheme catalyzed by TjhO5. (c) NMR analysis of 16. (d) Coupling constant of H-7 and H-6a in 1H NMR spectra of 15 and 16, respectively.
