Fig. 4. (a) Amino-acid sequence alignment of the sa76-encoded protein product with homologous replication initiation proteins from the given linear plasmids of other Streptomyces spp. The protein sequences and accession numbers are pSV2.111c (AAO50195), BN159_p125 (CCK32994), pFRL2_102c (YP_008995503), pSLA2-M.01 (BAK19795), SAP1_1 (NP_828750). (b) Alignment of the sa75-encoded protein product with its homologous proteins. The protein sequences and accession numbers are pFRL2_101c (YP_008995504), pSLA2-M.02 (BAK19796), pSV2.110c (AAO50194), BN159_p124 (CCK32993), SAP1_2 (NP_828751). Regions containing the predicted DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motifs are indicated above the sequence. Identical amino acid residues are highlighted in black, and similar residues are highlighted in grey. (c) Positions of the sa76 (blue arrow), sa75 (cyan arrow), tpgSa (red arrow), and tapSa (magenta arrow) homologues in other Streptomyces linear plasmids. The green arrow denotes the position of the ttrA-homologous gene encoding a DEAD box helicase which has a role in conjugal transfer (Huang et al., 2003). The grey box denotes the position of the non-coding sequence (ncs) essential for replication (Zhang et al., 2009, 2010).
