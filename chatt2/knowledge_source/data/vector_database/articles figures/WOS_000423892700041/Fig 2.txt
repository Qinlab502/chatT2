Fig. 2. Structural features of the terminal sequences of pSA3239. (a) Comparison of the ﬁrst 400 nucleotides of the left and right terminal sequences. Identical nucleotides in the alignment are shaded in black. Arrows with Roman numerals indicate palindromic sequences. The open boxes mark the asymmetrical center of each palindrome. (b) The secondary structures of the 3′-terminal 105 nucleotides of the left and right terminal sequences of pSA3239 predicted by Mfold (Zuker, 2003). Roman numerals indicate the palindromes seen in the alignment.
