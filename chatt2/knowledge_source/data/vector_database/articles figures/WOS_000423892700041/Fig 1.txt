Fig. 1. Gene organization of pSA3239. All predicted genes are shown in boxes. The genes lying above the line are encoded in the leading strand, those lying below the line are encoded in the reverse strand. Predicted biosynthetic gene clusters, regulatory genes, and replication and maintenance genes are designated by the given colour. Other genes are indicated by grey boxes. The left and right terminal inverted repeats (TIR-L and TIR-R) are shown by arrows. The thick arrows below the map indicate the overlapping DNA fragments of the corresponding cosmids used for sequencing. (For interpretation of the references to color in this Ô¨Ågure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
