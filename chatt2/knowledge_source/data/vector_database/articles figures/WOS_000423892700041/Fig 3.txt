Fig. 3. Comparison of the left and right terminal sequences of pSA3239 with several representative Streptomyces linear plasmid and chromosomal sequences belonging to the archetypal telomere family with distinguishable Tap binding regions (Bao and Cohen, 2003) and predicted palindromic sequences. For the linear plasmids, their designations are given; for the Streptomyces chromosomes, species names are given. Where two telomeric sequences are diﬀerent, “l” or “r” in brackets indicate the left or right telomeres. Identical nucleotides in the alignment are shaded in black. The arrows above the alignment with Roman numerals indicate the palindromic sequences of the pSA3239 telomere; those below the alignment indicate the palindromic sequences of the archetypal telomeres, as described previously (Kirby and Chen, 2011). The open boxes show the asymmetry at the center of the given palindrome.
