Fig. 5. (a) PFGE analysis of total DNA from the wild-type and the sa43 mutant S. aur- eofaciens strains. (b) Southern blot hybridization analysis of the PFGE gel with a DIG- labelled probe from pSA3239 (a 2.7-kb BamHI DNA fragment covering the sa44â€“sa46 genes, Fig. 1). The S lanes contain a lambda ladder standard.
