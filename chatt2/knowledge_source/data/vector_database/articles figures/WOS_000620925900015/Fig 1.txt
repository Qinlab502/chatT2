Figure 2. Metrics for the analysis of convergence applied to the syntheses from our laboratory. (a) Graph of steps required after the point of convergence to reach the target. (b) Graph of the diï¬€erence in the number of steps to synthesize each fragment. (c) Graph of the percentage of carbons present after fragment coupling. (d) Graph of the complexity generated in the fragment coupling step.
