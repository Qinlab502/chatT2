Fig. 2 Griselimycin self-resistance determinant. The griselimycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces caelicus encodes 26 protein-encoding genes (Broenstrup et al. 2014), including genes encoding nonribosomal peptide synthetases (nrps1, nrps2, nrps3), genes encoding transcription factors (xreI, xreII), and a gene encoding an additional copy of the DNA polymerase sliding clamp (griR), which was found to mediate self-resistance (Kling et al. 2015)
