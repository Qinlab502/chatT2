Photomicrographs a-d are treatments after 8 weeks. a A regular distribution of macrotrabecula (TRB) around the central vein showing clear rosette shape (RS). b Macrotrabecula (TRB) around the congested central vein (CCV) with mucinous secretion. c and d Hepatic nodules (HN) with irregular hepatocyte- undifferentiated HCC; the photos show marked changes of nuclear pyknotic (NP) with degenerated cytoplasm reflecting the figure of cirrhotic changes, and irregular hepatocytes (IRC).
