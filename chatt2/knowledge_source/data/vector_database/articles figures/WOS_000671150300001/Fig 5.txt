Figure 5. Effect of Chr-A on pro-inﬂammatory factors in the supernatants of BV2 cells. Cell viability of Chr-A on BV2 microglia cells (a). The effect of Chr-A on NO production (b). The levels of IL-6 (c), IL-1β (d) MCP-1 (e) and TNF-α (f) were assessed by ELISA. The expression level of COX2 was assessed by Western blot (g). LPS stimulating time was 24 h for above-mentioned analysis. Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Experiments were performed in triplicate. ## p < 0.01 vs. control group; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. LPS model group.
