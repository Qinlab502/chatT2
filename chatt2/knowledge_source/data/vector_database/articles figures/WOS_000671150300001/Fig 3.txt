Figure 3. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of core genes for Chr-A against neuroinﬂammation. Top 10 signiﬁcant GO terms are divided into BP, CC, and MF (a). Top 10 signiﬁcant KEGG pathways (b). PPI network of core genes for Chr-A against neuroinﬂammatory (c). Relative mRNA level of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, CCL2 and NLRP3 (n = 3) (d). Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. ## p < 0.01 vs. control group; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. LPS model group.
