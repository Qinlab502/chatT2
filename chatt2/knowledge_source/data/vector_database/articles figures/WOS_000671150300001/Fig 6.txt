Figure 6. Effect of Chr-A on NLRP3/Cleaved caspase-1 signaling pathway. Protein expression levels of NLRP3 (a), cleaved caspase-1 (b), IL-1β (c) and IL-18 (d) in BALB/c mice (n = 5). Protein expression levels of NLRP3 (e), cleaved caspase-1 (f), IL-1β (g) and IL-18 (h) in BV2 microglia cell. Experiments were performed in triplicate. LPS stimulating time was 24 h for NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1 and IL-1β Western blot analysis and 12 h for IL-18 Western blot analysis. Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM, # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 vs. control group; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. LPS model group.
