Figure 4. Effect of Chr-A on pro-inﬂammatory factors, chemokines and inﬂammation related protein the cortex of mice stimulated by LPS. The levels of IL-6 (a), IL-1β (b), IL-17 (c), TNF-α (d), MCP-1 (e), CXCL12 (f) and GM-CSF (g) were assessed by ELISA (n = 7–8). The expression level of COX2 (h) were assessed by Western blot (n = 5). Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 vs. control group; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. LPS model group.
