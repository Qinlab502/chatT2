Fig. 1. Structures of the metabolites investigated in this study and the path- way for dioxane biosynthesis. Structures of alnumycin A (1), prealnumycin (2), K1115 A (3), alnumycin B1 (4a) and B2 (4b), alnumycin C1 (5a), C2 (5b) and D, (6), and alnumycin S (7). Proposed shunt products of the pathway are shown in gray and the various hydroxyl groups of the attached ribose are color coded for clarity.
