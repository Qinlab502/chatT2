Fig. 4. Proposed mechanisms for reactions catalyzed by AlnA, AlnB, Aln6, and Aln4. (A) Attachment of ribose onto 2 by AlnA and AlnB. (B) Formation of dioxolane from the ribose moiety in 5 by Aln6. (C) Conversion of the dioxolane in 4 into a dioxane unit by Aln4. The position of the incorporated label from [5- 13C] D-ribose feeding experiments is marked with an asterisk.
