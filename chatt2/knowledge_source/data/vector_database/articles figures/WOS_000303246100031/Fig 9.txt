Fig. 5. Monitoring the Aln6 reaction. (A) Simultaneous formation of 4 (black triangles) and hydrogen peroxide (black squares) as estimated by an end- point assay vs. consumption of molecular oxygen (gray dots) in a continuous measurement. All reactions contained 170 μM 5 and 1.4 μM Aln6. (B) Ob- served changes in the UV-visible spectra during 80% conversion of 230 μM 5 to 4 by 1.6 μM Aln6. Reaction mixture is shown at the initial state (dark gray squares), after 2 min (black circles), and after 10 min incubation (light gray triangles).
