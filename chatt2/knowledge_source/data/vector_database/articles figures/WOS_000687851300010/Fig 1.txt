Figure 2. Mutagenesis strategy and fermentation proﬁles of f lsO1 mutants and structures of isolated compounds. (A) The constructive strategies for flsO1 insertional mutagenesis and flsO1-in-frame deletion mutants. (B) HPLC analysis of metabolite proﬁles of (i) M. rosaria SCSIO N160, (ii) the Δf lsO1 mutant by insertional mutagenesis, (iii) pCSG5033 (containing the intact f ls BGC), and (iv) pCSG5042 (ΔflsO1i). The symbol “●” denotes unrelated products, and the symbol “∗” denotes uncharacterized benzoﬂuorene-related products. (C) Structures of compounds isolated from the f lsO1 inactivation mutants.
