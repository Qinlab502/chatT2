Figure 2. Amino acid sequence analysis of MycE and MycF. A) Phylogenetic tree of selected O-methyltransferases generated by MegAlign (DNASTAR) with the Clustal W method. MycE and MycF are highlighted in bold and italic. The selected O-methyltransferases include MycE and MycF (mycinami- cin pathway), TylE and TylF (tylosin pathway), ChmMI and ChmMII (chalco- mycin pathway), SpnH, SpnI, and SpnK (spinosad pathway), BusH, BusI, and BusK (butenyl spinosyn pathway), SnogY (nogalamycin pathway), OleY (ole- andomycin pathway), ElmMI, ElmMII, and ElmMIII (elloramycin pathway), NovP (novobiocin pathway), CumN (coumermycin pathway), and MtfB (my- cobacterial serovar-specific glycopeptidolipid pathway). B) SAM binding motifs of MycE and its homologues. C) SAM binding motifs of MycF and its homologues.
