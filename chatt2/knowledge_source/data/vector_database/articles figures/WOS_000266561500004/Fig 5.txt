Figure 5. LCâ€“MS analysis (l = 280 nm) of in vitro conversions catalyzed by MycE and MycF. A) Mycinamicin VI (M-VI) standard; B) M-VI + MycE; C) M- VI + MycF; D) M-VI + MycE + MycF; E) mycinamicin III (M-III) standard; F) M- III + MycF; G) M-III + MycE; H) mycinamicin IV (M-IV) standard. Compound identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry and comparison with standard compound regarding retention time and co-injection.
