Fig. 3   Landomycin  A  production  by  S.  cyanogenus  rpsL  merodip- loids.  Please  see  Methods  section  and  (Yushchuk  et  al.  2018)  for  procedure  details.  Results  represent  mean  values  (three  repeats),  error  bars  represent  SD.  Significant  differences  in  landomycin  A  production  between  S136  (wild  type)  and  each  mutant  strain  were  calculated  by  a  two-tailed  t-test.  If  significant,  p-values  are  given  as  ***p ≤ 0.001; **0.001 < p ≤ 0.01; *0.01 < p ≤ 0.05
