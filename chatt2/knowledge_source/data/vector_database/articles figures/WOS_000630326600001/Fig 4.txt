Fig. 4   Streptomycin  resistance  of  S.  albus  strains.  a  Dried  weight  accumulation by SAM2, K88E and K88E_ex strains in TSB medium.  The  values  shown  as  mean  (four  repeats),  error  bars  represent  SD.  Significant  differences  in  dried  weight  accumulation  between  SAM2  (wild  type)  and  each  mutant  strain  at  each  timepoint  were  calculated  by  a  two-tailed  t-test.  If  significant,  p-values  are  given  as  ***p ≤ 0.001;  **0.001 < p ≤ 0.01;  *0.01 < p ≤ 0.05.  b  Survival  of  SAM2,  K88E  and  K88E_ex  on  streptomycin  (final  concentration  100  μg/mL).  10  μL  of  undiluted  and  1:103,  1:104,  1:105  dilutions  of  72-h  TSB  cultures  were  spotted  on  TSA  plates  with  and  without
