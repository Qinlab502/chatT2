Fig. 1   Detection  of  candicidins  in  extracts  from  S.  albus  strains.  a  UV  chromatograms  (at  404  nm)  of  extracts  from  SAM2  and  rpsL  merodiploids.  Candicidins  were  detected  based  on  UV  absorbance  and  m/z  value.  b  The  UV  spectrum  of  candicidins  with  retention  time 9.3 min in the extract from wild type strain (SAM2). Mentioned  merodiploids and SAM2 were cultivated for 144 h in NL19 medium,  extracts were prepared as described in Methods
