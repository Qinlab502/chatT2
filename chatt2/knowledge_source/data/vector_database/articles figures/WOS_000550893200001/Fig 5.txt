Figure 5. The complex structures of all pre-reaction states towards the eight possible diastereoisomers (INT).  The  weak  intermolecular  interactions  were  indicated  as  gray  isosurfaces  between  p-QM  (red)  and  FST2âˆ’  (blue) by IGM. Relative free energies and enthalpies (in kcal/mol) were calculated to the CMP-I.
