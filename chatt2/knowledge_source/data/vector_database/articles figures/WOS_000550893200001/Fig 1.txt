Figure 2. The proposed reaction mechanism for fluostatin conjugation in this work. (FST, fluostatin D; FST−,  fluostatin anion; TSda, transition state of deacyloxylation; p-QM, para-quinone methide; π-CMP, the low- energy π–π stacking pre-reaction complex; TScp, the low-energy transition state of C-C coupling; INT, the  immediate product of TScp; Prod, Difluostatin E.)
