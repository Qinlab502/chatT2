Figure 4. Prediction of the C–C coupling regioselectivity by frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) and Fukui  function (FF). (A,B) Isosurface of the LUMO and Fukui 𝑓(cid:2878) of electrophile p-QM, respectively; (C,D) those  of the HOMO and Fukui 𝑓(cid:2879) of nucleophile FST2− (FMO: isovalue = ±0.05 a.u., FF: isovalue = ±0.002 a.u.);  (E,F) Comparison of FMO coefficients and condensed FF for p-QM and FST2−, respectively.
