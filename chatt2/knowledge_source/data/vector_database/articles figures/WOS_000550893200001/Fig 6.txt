Figure 6. The calculated structures of TScp. (Bond lengths of the partially forming C–C bond are labeled,  and the total energy change between pre-reaction state (CMPs) and transition states (TScp) are marked in  black color, which consists of changes in the distortion energy of FST2− (blue), the distortion energy of p- QM (red), and the additional interaction energy for the C–C coupling.)
