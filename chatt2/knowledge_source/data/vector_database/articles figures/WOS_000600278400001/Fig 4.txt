Fig. 6  LCâ€“MS analysis of culture extract of S. albus: Chromosomally-integrated empty cosmid pOJ436e*oxyDPchdR (a) in comparison with culture  extract of S. albus with chromosomally-integrated cosmid carrying CHD BGC and oxyD, oxyP and chdR genes (pOJ436e*oxyDPchdR-CHD12) (b).  UV chromatograms at detection wavelength of 280 nm and EICs for m/z 412 (  0.5), which correspond to CHD and CDCHD,  respectively, are shown (chromatograms adapted from DataAnalysis (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen))
