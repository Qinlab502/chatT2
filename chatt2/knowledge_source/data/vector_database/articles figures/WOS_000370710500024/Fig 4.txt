Fig. 11 Analysis of Rg, RMSD, SASA, and hydrogen bond interactions of native and mutant Cht Mip-compound-175753 complexes at 20 000 ps. (a) Rg of the protein backbone over the entire simulation. The ordinate is Rg (nm), and the abscissa is residue. (b) Time evolution of backbone RMSDs of the native and mutant structures. (c) The ordinate is SASA (nm), and the abscissa is time (ns). The symbol coding scheme is as follows: native (green colour), mutant D170L (red colour), and Y213A (blue colour).
