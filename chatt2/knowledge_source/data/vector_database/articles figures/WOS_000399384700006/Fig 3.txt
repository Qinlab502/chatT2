Figure 3. a) Chemical structures derived from 1 after reactions with amines and amino acids. For detailed HPLC/MS data and conversion rates, see Figure S9 and Table S11, respectively. b) SDS-PAGE showing the labeling of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with 1. Top: white light, middle: fluorescence at 695 nm after excitation at 590â€“660 nm, bottom: coomassie staining. M: Prestained protein ladder (see Figure S12 for the full gel pictures). A time-limited trypsin digest of BSA was additionally analyzed. c) Fluorescence spectra of 1, 6, and 1 after reaction with BSA with lex = 425 nm. For UV chromatograms of 1, 6, and 1 after reaction with BSA and other fluorescence spectra at different wavelengths, see Figure S11.
