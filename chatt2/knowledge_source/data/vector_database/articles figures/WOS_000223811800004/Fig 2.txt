Figure 2. A) Oviedomycin production during the S. antibioticus ATCC 11891 cell cycle, growing on solid GAE medium. The arrows indicate the onset of substrate mycelium (sm) formation, aerial mycelium (am) formation and sporogenesis (sp). B) HPLC chromatograms of culture extracts from wild-type S. antibioticus ATCC 11891, S. antibioticus mutant O3 K1 (ovmK-minus mutant) and S. albus (cosAB3). Detection was carried out at 298 nm. Arrows show the mobility corre- sponding to oviedomycin.
