Fig. 2. The glycogenomic workﬂow for characterization of GNPs from genome-sequenced microbes. (A) Tandem mass-spectrometric analysis of microbial metabolic samples can reveal biosynthetic building blocks such as amino acids and sugar monomers of natural products via tandem MS fragment ions. (B) Identiﬁcation of putative GNPs in a LC-MSn analysis as peaks in EICs of known sugar fragment masses. (C) Veriﬁcation of putative GNPs by characterization of candidate sugar monomers by sugar neutral losses and corresponding sugar fragment ions in tandem MS spectra. (D) Connection of putative GNP chemotype with corresponding GNP genotype in target microbial genome by genome mining of GNP pathway with glycosylation genes matching observed sugar fragments. (E) Characterization of GNP chemotype by analysis of aglycone biosynthetic genes of candidate GNP pathway and further structure elucidation.
