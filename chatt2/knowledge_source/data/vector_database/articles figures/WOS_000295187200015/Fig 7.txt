Figure 7. Results of ZhuI pocket residue mutagenesis as tested in vitro. (A) HPLC analysis (traces displayed at 270 nm) of the product profiles obtained by in vitro reconstitution of polyketide biosynthesis utilizing the PKS4 minPKS with WT or mutant ZhuI ARO/CYC. (B) Product profiles of additional pocket arginine mutants (R66Q, R66E, and R66K). The inset shows the amino acid side chain groups at residue position 66 for WT and mutant ZhuI as assayed. (C) Structure of ZhuI showing the mutated pocket residues as spheres.
