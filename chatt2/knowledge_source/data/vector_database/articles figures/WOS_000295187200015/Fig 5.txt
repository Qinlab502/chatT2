Figure 5. Structure of ZhuI with CAPS bound. (A) Overall view with the protein backbone rendered as a cartoon and residues within 4 Å of the CAPS molecule drawn as sticks. Potential hydrogen bonds are represented as dashed lines. The structure of CAPS (N-cyclohexyl-3- aminopropanesulfonic acid) is drawn below ZhuI. (B) Stereoview of interacting residues. Blue mesh around the bound ligand is derived from the 2.4 Å |2Fo − Fc| electron density map contoured to 0.8σ.
