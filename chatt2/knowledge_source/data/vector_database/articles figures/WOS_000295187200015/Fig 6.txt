Figure 6. Docking of putative polyketide intermediates into the ARO/CYC pocket. (A) Docking of the 18-carbon intermediate 1 (Figure 1), the putative product of ZhuI. (B) Docking of a putative 20-carbon bicyclic aromatic intermediate with TcmN ARO/CYC. For both panels, the left image is a cutaway mesh surface view showing the positions of the docked molecules and the right image is a view of interactions of pocket residues with the docked compounds.
