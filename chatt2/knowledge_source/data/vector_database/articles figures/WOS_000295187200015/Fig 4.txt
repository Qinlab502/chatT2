Figure 4. Overall structure of ZhuI and a comparison with TcmN ARO/CYC. (A) ZhuI dimer structure (left). Î²-Strands at the dimer interface are labeled, and the noncrystallographic 2-fold rotation axis relating the two monomers is colored red. Close-up view of the dimer interface (middle). Illustration of the complementarity and chemical nature of the dimer contact surface (right). One monomer is represented as an electrostatic surface (red for electronegative, blue for electropositive, and gray for neutral), and the other is drawn as a cartoon with interacting residues as sticks. (B) Monomer structure of ZhuI with secondary structure elements labeled and two interacting residues (V55 and V138) shown as spheres. (C) Crystal structure of TcmN ARO/CYC with residues P56 and H128 (structurally equivalent to those listed for panel B) drawn as spheres (see the sequence alignment in Figure 3B. (D) Backbone overlay of ZhuI and TcmN ARO/CYC.
