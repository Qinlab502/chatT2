Figure 3. Sequence alignment of ZhuI ARO/CYC with (A) the N-half ARO/CYC domain (residues 1−156) of the didomain protein ActVII from S. coelicolor and (B) the ARO/CYC domain (residues 1−157) of TcmN from Streptomyces glaucescens. ActVII is associated with dehydration and aromatization of a C7−C12 cyclized first ring, whereas TcmN ARO/CYC is associated with C9−C14 first-ring cyclization. Secondary structure elements shown on the top of each alignment are identified according to the ZhuI structure, and asterisks below the alignments denote pocket- defining residues.
