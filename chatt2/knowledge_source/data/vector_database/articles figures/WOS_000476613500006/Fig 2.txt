Figure 4. Solid-State NMR-Based Structure of the [PRM-A2/Ca2+/D-Man-OMe2] Complex (A) Relative geometry of PRM-A and D-Man-OMe in the [PRM-A2/Ca2+/D-Man2] complex obtained by previous DARR analysis. (B) Energy-minimized structure of the [PRM-A2/Ca2+/D-Man-OMe2] complex obtained by DFT calculations. Carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and calcium atoms are shown in gray, red, blue, white, and green, respectively. Hydrogen bonding and Ca2+ coordination are indicated as blue and green dotted lines, respectively. See also Figure S2.
