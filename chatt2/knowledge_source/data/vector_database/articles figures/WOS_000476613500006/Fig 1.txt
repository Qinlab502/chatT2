Figure 3. DARR Analysis of the [PRM-A2/Ca2+/D-Man-OMe2] Complex (A) Enlarged view of the dimeric structure. Carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and calcium atoms are shown in gray, red, blue, white, and green, respectively. The 11-O-methyl group of one molecule of 1 is in the proximity of the D-serine moiety of the other. (B) 13C-Enriched PRM-A used in DARR analysis. Red (ca. 60 atom % 13C). and blue (ca. 65 atom % 13C) circles indicate 13C-enriched positions. The 13C population of the aromatic moiety was also slightly increased (ca. 15 atom % 13C). The 13C population was calculated from solution 1H-NMR data on the basis of integration values of proton signals split with 1Hâ€“13C couplings. See also Figure S1. (C) 2D-DARR spectra of the [PRM-A2/Ca2+/D-Man-OMe2] complex at the mixing times of 500 ms (left) and 20 ms (right). Blue and red arrows represent 13C signals of 13C-enriched positions.
