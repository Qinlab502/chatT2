Figure 2. In Vitro Quinone-Forming Activities of the Recombinant FMOs (A) SDS-PAGE analysis of the recombinant FMOs used for in vitro assay. (B) Quinone-forming activities of the FMOs. Emodinanthrone was used as the substrate. (a) boiled ActVA-ORF5/ActVB as negative control. A small amount of emodin was spontaneously formed by autoxidation, (b) ActVA-ORF5/ ActVB, (c) Gra-21/ActVB, (d) Med-7/ActVB, (e) AlnT/ActVB, and (f) AlnT/AlnH. Chromatograms monitored by absorbance at 254 nm are shown. See also Figure S1 and Table S3.
