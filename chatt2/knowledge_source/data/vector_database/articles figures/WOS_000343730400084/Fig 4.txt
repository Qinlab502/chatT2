Figure 4. Phosphorylation assays with small phospho-donors. Phosphorylation of DrrBN (A), AbrA2 (B) or AbrA2N (C) proteins with acetylphosphate (AP), carbamoylphosphate (CP) or phosphoramidate (PA) visualized with the Phos-tag stain in SDS-PAGE (‘‘-’’ means no phospho-donor added). In the bottom part of each panel the amount of protein used is shown with a Coomassie blue stain. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0109844.g004
