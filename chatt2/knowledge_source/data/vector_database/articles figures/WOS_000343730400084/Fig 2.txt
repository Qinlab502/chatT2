Figure 2. Auto-regulation of AbrA2 and dependence on Fe. A) Scheme of plasmids for xylanase gene expression (xysA) used as reporter. Plasmid pNA4: xysA under the control of abrA promoter (abrAp) was used, and plasmid pNX4: xysA under the control of its own promoter xysAp was used as a control. B) Top left panel: xysA expression triggered by pNA4 (abrAp) in the parent strain (M145) and the DabrA1/ A2 mutant (DabrA), respectively, is shown. Top right panel, control expression by xysAp (pNX4) in both strains is shown. C) Western blot showing xysA expression under abrAp (plasmid pNA4), or xysAp, in the parent strain M145 in different medium (plasmid pNX4) conditions: complete NMMP, low-Fe or low-Mg media. The xylanase signal corresponds to western blot assays using anti-xysA against supernatants of 7-day cultures in NMMP medium (100 mL of pNA4 and 2 mL of pNX4). In the bottom panels of B and C the amount of protein loaded in each lane is shown with a Coomassie blue stain. Two independent cultures of each construction are shown. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0109844.g002
