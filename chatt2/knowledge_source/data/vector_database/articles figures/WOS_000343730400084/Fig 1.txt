Figure 1. AbrA1 HK signal response in NMMP. ACT production (blue colour) of the parent strain (M145) and the mutant DabrA1/A2 (DabrA) in NMMP complete medium and different modified versions lacking (w/o) one or several compounds of the original recipe. All plates were inoculated as a lawn with 7.56106 spores of the corresponding strains and the images correspond to backward sections of the plates after four days at 30uC. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0109844.g001
