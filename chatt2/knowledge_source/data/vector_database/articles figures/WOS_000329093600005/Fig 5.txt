Fig. 6 a Comparison of all the SARP family homologues in the auricin cluster and in the flanking regions with the well-known representatives of this family, ActII-ORF4 of S. coelicolor (Fernandez-Moreno et al. 1991) and DnrI of S. peucetius (Sheldon et al. 2002). The predicted secondary structure of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of the SARP family (Wietzorreck and Bibb 1997) is shown, indicating the HTH motif.
