Fig. 1 Genetic organisation of the auricin aur1 cluster and its flanking regions. Each thick arrow denotes the direction of expression and the size of the gene. The dark gray arrows correspond to the auricin genes, the light gray arrows to the putative PKS and accessory genes, the black arrows to the regulatory genes, the hatched arrows to the linear plasmid
