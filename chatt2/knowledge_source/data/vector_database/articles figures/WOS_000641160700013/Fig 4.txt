Figure 4. Production of aloesin (8) from glucose. (a) Production of aloesone (7) by testing diﬀerent copies of aloesone synthase (ALS). The plasmids pCDF-RpALS and/or pRSF-RpALS were additionally introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pWAS-anti-pabA and pBBR1-zwf for the ﬂask culture. (b) Production of 8 by employing GtCGT (noted as CGT) or the GtCGT mutant (GtCGTV93Q/Y193F, denoted as CGTmut). pCDF-GtCGT, pCDF-GtCGTmut, or pCDF-RpALS-GtCGTmut was additionally introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pWAS-anti-pabA, pBBR1-zwf, and pRSF-RpALS for the ﬂask culture. (c) EICs generated by LC-MS and fragmentation patterns of 8 generated by MS/MS from the authentic standard (upper panels) or from the culture sample of the ALS strain (lower panels). Data are representative of three independent replicates. Peak annotation and fragment structures were modeled using the CFM-ID tool.49 Orientations of the fragment ions were adjusted to that of the precursor ion so that fragmentation could be easily identiﬁed. Parent ions are marked with ﬁlled diamonds. The m/ztheoretical and m/ zobserved values noted are for the parent ions [M − H]−. (a, b) Error bars are mean ± SD (n = 3). *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001, determined by a two- tailed Student’s t-test. NS denotes not signiﬁcant.
