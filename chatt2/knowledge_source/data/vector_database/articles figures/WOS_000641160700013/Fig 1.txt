Figure 1. Employment of type II and type III PKS machineries for the production of octaketide shunt products (1 and 2) and ﬂavokermesic acid (3). (a) Schematic description of the mechanism of the type II PKS system. Abbreviations: PPTase, phosphopantetheinyl transferase; MCAT, malonyl-CoA:ACP malonyltransferase; ACP, acyl-carrier protein; KS, ketosynthase. (b) Schematic description of the mechanism of the type III PKS system. (c) Production of 1 and 2 by diﬀerent combinations of the type II PKS components. Abbreviation: Het ACP, heterologous ACP. n = 3. (d) Production of 3 by applying diﬀerent metabolic engineering strategies. Type III PKS denotes AaPKS5 (expressed together with ZhuIJ). Type II PKS denotes AntDEFBG and ZhuIJ expressed from a single plasmid (pFK) or two plasmids (pDS00-antDEFBG and pCDF-zhuIJ). Abbreviations: accBCD1 OE, C. glutamicum accBCD1 (encoding acetyl-CoA carboxylase) overexpression; KD, knockdown. Error bars denote mean ± standard deviation (SD; n = 3). (c, d) *P < 0.0125, **P < 0.0025, ***P < 0.00025, determined by a two-tailed Student’s t-test. P value thresholds were adjusted using a Bonferroni correction (corrected signiﬁcance levels represented as α/m; α, original signiﬁcance level; m, number of hypotheses). NS denotes not signiﬁcant.
