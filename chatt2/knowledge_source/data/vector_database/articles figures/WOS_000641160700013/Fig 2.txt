Figure 2. Production of carminic acid precursors (4 and 5). (a) Production of kermesic acid (4) by employing diﬀerent monooxygenase candidates identiﬁed by a biochemical reaction analysis. *P < 0.01, ***P < 0.0002, determined by a two-tailed Student’s t-test. P value thresholds were adjusted using a Bonferroni correction (P < α/m). NS denotes not signiﬁcant. (b) Extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) generated by LC-MS and MS/MS fragmentation patterns of 4 and its isomer 4′ produced by the FK strain additionally harboring dnrF. (c) Production of dcII (5) by employing diﬀerent C-glucosyltransferase candidates identiﬁed by a biochemical reaction analysis. *P < 0.05, determined by a two-tailed Student’s t-test. (d) EICs generated by LC-MS and MS/MS fragmentation patterns of 5 and its isomer 5′ produced by the FK strain additionally harboring GtCGT. (a, c) Error bars denote mean ± SD (n = 3). CT denotes the control FK strain. (b, d) Data are representative of three independent replicates. Peak annotation and fragment structures were modeled using the CFM-ID tool.49 Orientations of the fragment ions were adjusted to that of the precursor ion so that fragmentation could be easily identiﬁed. Parent ions are marked with ﬁlled diamonds. The m/ztheoretical and m/ zobserved values noted are for the parent ions [M − H]−.
