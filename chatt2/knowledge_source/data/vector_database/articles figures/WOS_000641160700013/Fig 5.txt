Figure 5. Production of carminic acid (6) from glucose. (a) Production of 6 by applying diﬀerent metabolic engineering strategies. *P < 0.0071, **P < 0.0014, determined by a two-tailed Student’s t-test. P value thresholds were adjusted using a Bonferroni correction (P < α/m). (b) Production of 6 by coexpression of chaperones. Abbreviations: KD, knockdown; OE, overexpression. Error bars are the mean ± SD (standard deviation; n = 3). **P < 0.002, determined by a two-tailed Student’s t-test. P value thresholds were adjusted using a Bonferroni correction (P < α/ m). NS, not signiﬁcant. (c) EICs generated by LC-MS and fragmentation patterns of 6 generated by MS/MS in MRM mode from the authentic standard (upper panels) or from the culture sample of the CA-ACC strain (lower panels). Data are representative of three independent replicates (Figure S17). Peak annotation and fragment structures were modeled using the CFM-ID tool.49 Orientations of the fragment ions were adjusted to that of the precursor ion so that fragmentation could be easily identiﬁed. The m/ztheoretical and m/zobserved values noted are for the parent ions [M − H]−.
