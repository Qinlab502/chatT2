Figure 3. Homology modeling and docking simulations of DnrF and GtCGT for enhanced enzymatic activities. (a) Enhanced production of 4 by testing DnrF mutants predicted by in silico simulations. (b) The mutated amino acid residue (P217K) and the mode of the ligand (3) binding in the best DnrF mutant (DnrFP217K). (c) Enhanced production of 5 by testing GtCGT mutants predicted by in silico simulations. (d) Major amino acid residues (including the mutated amino acid residues V93Q and Y193F) interacting with the ligand (3) in the best GtCGT mutant (GtCGTV93Q/Y193F). (a, c) n = 2.
