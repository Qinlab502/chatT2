Figure 6. Time proﬁles of the fed-batch fermentation of the CA-ACC strain producing 6. Fed-batch fermentation proﬁles of CA-ACC regarding (a) 6 and DCW, (b), intermediates 3−5, and (c) shunt products 1 and 2. The proﬁles of independently repeated fed-batch fermentation of CA- ACC are shown in (d−f), showing reproducibility. The red arrow denotes the isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction time point. DCW denotes dry cell weight.
