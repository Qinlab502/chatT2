Figure 2. (a) Induced expression screening. Positive-acting SARP transcription factors found in minimal-PKS-containing eDNA clones were cloned under the control of the ermE* promoter. Extracts from transformed with this construct and the S. albus cultures corresponding minimal-PKS-containing clone were screened for bioactivities. (b) HPLC traces of S. albus culture-broth extracts. S. albus was transformed with (i) AZ60 and the TamI expression construct, (ii) AZ60 alone, (iii) an empty cosmid vector, (iv) the TamI expression construct alone, (v) AZ917 and the TamI expression construct, and (vi) a 79 kb BAC and the TamI expression construct. The utilization of compatible φC31 (cosmid vector)- and φBT1 (ermE* expression vector)-based integrative cloning systems allowed for the cointegration of both a biosynthetic gene cluster and a into two distinct corresponding induced transcriptional activator chromosomal sites in S. albus, resulting in the successful activation of previously silent eDNA gene clusters.
