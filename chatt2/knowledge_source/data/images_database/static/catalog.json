Type II PKS is composed of multiple stand-alone enzymes cooperatively processing the ACP-tethered substrate. Type III PKS forms a homodimer and can use CoA substrates for iterative elongations. B) Overall scheme of type II PKS biosynthesis that makes aromatic polyketides and highly reducing type II PKS biosynthesis that makes polyene polyketides.",
